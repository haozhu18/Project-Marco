0,paris,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris," Paris' monument-lined boulevards, museums, classical bistros and boutiques are enhanced by a new wave of multimedia galleries, creative wine bars, design shops and tech start-ups. The cloud-piercing, wrought-iron Eiffel Tower, broad Arc de Triomphe guarding the glamorous avenue des Champs-Élysées, flying buttressed Notre Dame cathedral, lamplit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes' wicker-chair-lined terraces are enduring Parisian emblems. Despite initial appearances, however, Paris’ cityscape isn’t static: there are some stunning modern and contemporary icons, too, from the inside-out, industrial-style Centre Pompidou to the mur végétal (vertical garden) gracing the Musée du Quai Branly, the glass sails of the Fondation Louis Vuitton contemporary-art centre, and the gleaming steel egg-shaped concert venue La Seine Musicale. France’s reputation for its cuisine (the French word for ‘kitchen’) precedes it, and whether you seek a cosy neighbourhood bistro or a triple-Michelin-starred temple to gastronomy, you'll find that every establishment prides itself on exquisite preparation and presentation of quality produce, invariably served with wine. Enticing patisseries, boulangeries (bakeries), fromageries (cheese shops) and crowded, colourful street markets are perfect for putting together a picnic to take to the city’s beautiful parks and gardens. A host of culinary courses – held anywhere from home kitchens to the world’s most prestigious cookery schools – offers instruction for all schedules, abilities and budgets. The word 'Parisian' is synonymous with style, and fashion shopping is the city’s forte. Paris remains at the forefront of international trends, and browsing emerging and established designer boutiques and flagship haute couture houses is a quintessential part of any visit. You’ll also find hip concept and homewares shops, and resplendent art nouveau department stores, along with a trove of vintage shops and flea markets, atmospheric bookshops and dark-green bouquiniste stalls stocking secondhand titles along the riverbanks, adorable children’s wear and toy shops, art and antique dealers, venerable establishments selling professional cookware, and, of course, gourmet-food and wine shops galore. With an illustrious artistic pedigree – Renoir, Rodin, Picasso, Monet, Manet, Dalí and Van Gogh are but a few of the masters who have lived and worked here over the years – Paris is one of the world's great art repositories, harbouring treasures from antiquity onwards. In addition to big hitters like the incomparable Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay’s exceptional impressionist collection, and the Centre Pompidou’s cache of modern and contemporary art, scores of smaller museums showcase every imaginable genre, a diverse range of venues mount major exhibitions through to offbeat installations, and there's also the city's vibrant street art.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-500759045_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,France,39,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187147,"([(""Musee d'Orsay"", 'This beautiful museum, once a railroad station, now houses a staggering collection of Impressionist art, as well as other items created between 1848 and 1914.

1,london,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london," One of the world's most visited cities, London has something for everyone: from history and culture to fine food and good times. Immersed in history, London's rich seams of eye-opening antiquity are everywhere. The city's buildings are striking milestones in a unique and beguiling biography, and a great many of them – the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben – are instantly recognisable landmarks. There’s more than enough innovation (the Shard, the Tate Modern extension, the Sky Garden) to put a crackle in the air, but it never drowns out London’s seasoned, centuries-old narrative. Architectural grandeur rises up all around you in the West End, ancient remains dot the City and charming pubs punctuate the historic quarters, leafy suburbs and river banks. Take your pick. A tireless innovator of art and culture, London is a city of ideas and the imagination. Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers (and critics), but until not so long ago people were suspicious of anything they considered avant-garde. That’s in the past now, and the city’s creative milieu is streaked with left-field attitude, whether it's theatrical innovation, contemporary art, pioneering music, writing, poetry, arelhichitecture or design. Food is another creative arena that has become a tireless obsession in certain circles. This city is deeply multicultural, with one in three Londoners foreign-born, representing 270 nationalities and 300 tongues. The UK may have voted for Brexit (although the majority of Londoners didn't), but for now London remains one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, and diversity infuses daily life, food, music and fashion. It even penetrates intrinsically British institutions; the British Museum and Victoria & Albert Museum have collections as varied as they are magnificent, while the flavours at centuries-old Borough Market run the full global gourmet spectrum. London is as much about wide-open vistas and leafy landscape escapes as it is high-density, sight-packed urban exploration. Central London is where the major museums, galleries and most iconic sights congregate, but visit Hampstead Heath or the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to flee the crowds and frolic in wide open green expanses. You can also venture further out to Kew Gardens, Richmond or Hampton Court Palace for beautiful panoramas of riverside London followed by a pint in a quiet waterside pub.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/55425108.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Kingdom,97.74,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,186338,"([('Tower of London', 'Discover London’s castle – a secure fortress, royal palace and infamous prison where you can explore 1000 years of history.

2,new-york-city,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city," Epicenter of the arts. Architectural darling. Dining and shopping capital. Trendsetter. New York City wears many crowns, and spreads an irresistible feast for all. The Met, MoMA and the Guggenheim are just the beginning of a dizzying list of art-world icons. You’ll find museums devoted to everything from fin de siècle Vienna to medieval European treasures, and sprawling galleries filled with Japanese sculpture, postmodern American painting, Himalayan textiles and New York City lore. For a glimpse of current and future greats, delve into the cutting-edge galleries of Chelsea and the Lower East Side, with their festive opening-night parties (usually Thursday night if you want to join in), or head to new frontiers in Brooklyn and Queens. With its compact size and streets packed with eye candy of all sorts – architectural glories, Old World cafes, atmospheric booksellers – NYC is a wanderer’s delight. Crossing continents is as easy as walking a few avenues in this jumbled city of 200-plus nationalities. You can lose yourself in the crowds of Chinatown amid bright Buddhist temples and steaming noodle shops, then stroll up to Nolita for enticing boutiques and coffee tasting. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of the city, from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the meandering cobblestone lanes of Greenwich Village. And the best way to experience it is to walk its streets. When the sun sinks slowly beyond the Hudson and luminous skyscrapers light up the night, New York transforms into one grand stage. Well-known actors take to the legendary theaters of Broadway and world-class soloists, dancers and musicians perform at venues large and small across town. Whether high culture or low, New York embraces it all: in-your-face rock shows at Williamsburg dives, lavish opera productions at the Lincoln Center, and everything in between. This is a city of experimental theater, improv comedy, indie cinema, ballet, poetry, burlesque, jazz and so much more. If you can dream it up, it’s probably happening. There’s never been a better time to dine in New York. It's a hotbed of seasonal and locally sourced cuisine – with restaurants growing vegetables on roof gardens or upstate farms, sourcing meats and seafood from nearby sustainable outfits, and embracing artisanal everything, from coffee roasting and whiskey distilling to chocolate and cheese making. Bars have also taken creativity to new heights, with pre-Prohibition-era cocktails served alongside delectable small plates – indeed, gastropubs are some of the most creative places to eat these days. Of course, you can also hit a gourmet food truck or dine at one of the city's 75 Michelin-starred restaurants.

3,los-angeles,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/los-angeles," Ruggedly good looking, deeply creative, with a sunny disposition to boot…if LA were on Tinder, the app would crash. Envy is an ugly thing, New York. While your denizens spend their time sniffling and throwing shade in the snow, Angelenos are busy riding waves, tying up their hiking boots and counting their copious blessings. Think about it: in how many megalopolises can you gallop across rugged mountains just nine miles from City Hall? Despite its heaving head count, LA is a city indelibly tied to mighty Mother Nature. Here, dense, vibrant neighborhoods back onto golden beaches, city streets lead up to flower-carpeted hillsides, and huge, deep-blue skies are an IMAX screen for lingering sunsets made to pierce your heart. Dreams are serious business in La La Land. Home to Hollywood, this is a city where fantastical thoughts are encouraged; a place gleefully wrapped in endless layers of modern legend and mythology. Every year countless small-town dreamers pour onto its streets, itching to share their tales with LA and the world – on screen and stage, in lyrics, or on the whitewashed walls of galleries. The end result is an electrifying whirlpool of creativity: edgy art spaces, cult-status rock venues, acclaimed concert halls and thought-provoking stages, all fueling a city addicted to the weird, the wonderful and the downright scandalous. LA's obsession with creative expression extends to its stucco and mortar. After all, this is where movie palaces look like Chinese temples and ancient Egyptian tombs, where concerts halls twist and curve like steely cartoon characters, and where soda bottling plants look like landlocked ocean liners. Indeed, LA celebrates architectural diversity with astounding gusto. From storybook Hollywood abodes and Silver Lake modernist prototypes, to downtown theaters channeling the Palace of Versailles, no other American city delivers such a thrilling mash-up of architectural styles, statements and role models…often on the very same palm-studded street. So which really has the better food scene: LA or SF? While the latter may claim more Michelin stars, LA packs one heck of a culinary punch. It's here that you'll find California's best tacos, the country's most authentic Korean and one of the nation's biggest concentrations of vegan restaurants. And when it comes to imbibing, SF best take a cable car home. From dirty martinis in a basement power station, to craft brews in a steampunk bowling alley, LA has a knack for turning humble drinking sessions into otherworldly adventures worthy of a toast or three.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/9cc94ba08ddfdac2721c25534bc224b0-los-angeles.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,32655,"([('The Getty Center', 'Spectacular museum boasts a most impressive collection by such luminaries as Van Gogh, Monet and Cezanne, along with the architectural triumph of its six buildings and gardens.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0d/65/f0/cf/getty-center.jpg'), ('Santa Monica State Beach', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/09/17/a1/bf/santa-monica-beach.jpg'), ('26-Mile Bike Path', 'Starting at the Santa Monica pier, this is a popular path for biking, jogging and in-line skating along the Pacific Ocean.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/d4/ed/f6/26-mile-bike-path.jpg'), ('Griffith Observatory', 'A public observatory owned and operated by the City of Los Angeles for the benefit of all.

4,rome,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome," A heady mix of haunting ruins, awe-inspiring art and vibrant street life, Italy’s hot-blooded capital is one of the world’s most romantic and charismatic cities. The result of 3000 years of ad hoc urban development, Rome's cityscape is an exhilarating sight. Ancient icons such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon recall the city’s golden age as caput mundi (capital of the world), while monumental basilicas tell of its history as seat of the Catholic Church. Lording it over the skyline, St Peter’s Basilica towers over the Vatican, testifying to the ambition of Rome’s Renaissance popes and the genius of its game-changing architects. Elsewhere, ornate piazzas and showy fountains add a baroque flourish to the city's captivating streets. Few cities can rival Rome's astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing top artists and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums; Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in art-rich churches; baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Stroll through the centre and without even trying you’ll come across masterpieces by the titans of European art – sculptures by Michelangelo, paintings by Caravaggio, frescoes by Raphael and fountains by Bernini. A trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture. Idling around picturesque streets, whiling away hours at streetside cafes, people-watching on pretty piazzas – these are all central to the Roman experience. The tempo rises in the evening when fashionable drinkers descend on the city’s bars and cafes for a sociable aperitivo (drink with snacks) and trattorias hum with activity. Elsewhere, cheerful hordes mill around popular haunts before heading off to hip cocktail bars and late-night clubs. Eating out is one of Rome's great pleasures and the combination of romantic alfresco settings and superlative food is a guarantee of good times. For contemporary fine dining and five-star wine there are any number of refined restaurants, but for a truly Roman meal head to a boisterous pizzeria or convivial neighbourhood trattoria. That's where the locals go to indulge their passion for thin, crispy pizzas, humble pasta dishes, and cool white wines from the nearby Castelli Romani hills. To finish off, what can beat a gelato followed by a shot of world-beating coffee?",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-roman-sunset-77415821.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Italy,34,Level 3: Reconsider Travel,187791,"([(""St. Peter's Basilica"", ""Arguably one of the finest Cathedrals in the entire world, St. Peter's is the spiritual center of the Vatican and the product of many of Italy's great Renaissance's architects, among them Bramante, Raphael and Michelangelo."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/fc/ee/a8/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Colosseum', 'Perhaps the best-preserved of the monuments of ancient Rome, this huge marble structure was built to hold more than 50,000 spectators to witness bloody contests of might and the slaughter of wild beasts.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/f0/1c/e4/italy-colosseum-rome.jpg'), ('Pantheon', 'Dedicated to the seven planetary divinities and featuring an interior of gorgeous marble, the Pantheon is one of the most impressive monuments of Augustan Rome.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/2a/42/89/di-notte-quando-non-c.jpg'), ('Roman Forum', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/15/9f/5a/25/rome-italy.jpg'), ('Oasi Naturista Capocotta', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/05/28/43/oasi-naturista-capocotta.jpg'), ('Palatine Hill', 'The commercial, political and religious center of ancient Rome, which features the Arch of Septimus Severus, Temple of Saturn, Arch of Titus and the House of the Vestals.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/10/f7/f0/b1/img-20171013-132257-069.jpg'), ('Ancient Rome', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/05/b5/32/8b/ancient-rome.jpg'), ('Piazza Navona', ""The most outstanding square of the Baroque period in Rome features Bernini's Fountain of Rivers at its center as it faces Borromini's church, Sant' Agnese in Agone."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/98/2e/26/psx-20180701-185558-largejpg.jpg'), ('Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore', 'One of seven pilgrimage basilicas in the world, this church was founded in 432 AD and is where the famous architect Bernini is buried.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/63/3f/82/img-20190207-094757-largejpg.jpg'), ('Galleria Borghese', 'The Museum in the beautiful setting of Villa Borghese in Rome preserves sculptures, reliefs and ancient mosaics, and paintings and sculptures from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century.

5,sydney,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/sydney," Sydney, spectacularly draped around its glorious harbour and beaches, has visual wow factor like few other cities. Scratch the surface and it only gets better. National parks ring the city and penetrate right into its heart. Large chunks of harbour are still bush-fringed, while parks cut their way through skyscrapers and suburbs. Consequently, native critters turn up in the most surprising places. Clouds of flying foxes pass overhead at twilight and spend the night rustling around in suburban fig trees; oversized spiders stake out corners of lounge-room walls; possums rattle over roofs of terrace houses; and sulphur-crested cockatoos screech from the railings of urban balconies. At times Sydney's concrete jungle seems more like an actual one – and doesn't that just make it all the more exciting? After a lazy Saturday at the beach, urbane Sydneysiders have a disco nap, hit the showers and head out again. There's always a new restaurant to try, undercover bar to hunt down, hip band to check out, sports team to shout at, show to see or crazy party to attend. The city's pretensions to glamour are well balanced by a casualness that means a cool T-shirt and a tidy pair of jeans will get you in most places. But if you want to dress up and show off, there's plenty of opportunity for that among the sparkling harbour lights. Defined just as much by its rugged Pacific coastline as its exquisite harbour, Sydney relies on its coastal setting to replenish its reserves of charm; venture too far away from the water and the charm suddenly evaporates. Jump on a ferry and Sydney's your oyster – the harbour prises the city's two halves far enough apart to reveal an abundance of pearls. On the coast, Australia ends abruptly in sheer walls of sandstone punctuated by arcs of golden sand. In summer they're covered with bronzed bodies making the most of a climate that encourages outdoor socialising, exercising, flirting and fun. Brash is the word that inevitably gets bandied around when it comes to describing the Harbour City, and let's face it, compared to its Australian sister cities, Sydney is loud, uncompromising and in your face. Fireworks displays are more dazzling here, heels are higher, bodies more buffed, contact sports more brutal, starlets shinier, drag queens glitzier and prices higher. Australia’s best musos, foodies, actors, stockbrokers, models, writers and architects flock to the city to make their mark, and the effect is dazzling: a hyperenergetic, ambitious, optimistic and unprincipled marketplace of the soul, where anything goes and everything usually does.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/65830387.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Australia,97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,255060,"([('Sydney Opera House', ""One of the most iconic buildings in the world – the Sydney Opera House is an architectural masterpiece and vibrant performance space.

6,tokyo,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/tokyo," Yoking past and future, Tokyo dazzles with its traditional culture and passion for everything new. More than any one sight, it's the city itself that enchants visitors. It's a sprawling, organic thing, stretching as far as the eye can see. Always changing, and with a diverse collection of neighbourhoods, no two experiences of the city are ever the same. Some neighbourhoods feel like a vision from the future, with ever taller, sleeker structures popping up each year; others evoke the past with low-slung wooden buildings and glowing lanterns radiating surprising warmth; elsewhere, drab concrete blocks hide art galleries and cocktail bars and every lane hints at possible discoveries. In Tokyo you can experience the whole breadth of Japanese arts and culture. Centuries-old forms of performing arts still play on stages and sumo tournaments draw crowds; every spring, Tokyoites head outside to appreciate the cherry blossoms – a tradition older than the city itself. There are museums covering every era of Japanese art history and also ones that focus on the contemporary – challenging the old distinctions between art with a capital A, pop culture and technology. But there's a playful side to all of this, too: Tokyo is, after all, a city whose public artworks include a scale model of an anime robot. When it comes to Tokyo superlatives, the city's food scene tops the list. But we're not just talking about the famous restaurants and the celebrity chefs: what Tokyo excels at is consistency across the board. Wherever you are, you're usually within 100m of a good, if not great, restaurant. It's a scene that careens nonchalantly between the highs and lows: it's not unusual for a top-class sushi restaurant to share the same block as an oil-spattered noodle joint, and for both to be equally adored. Tokyoites love dining out; join them, and delight in the sheer variety of tastes and experiences the city has to offer. Tokyo can seem daunting at first: the subway map – a tangle of intersecting lines – is often compared to a bowl of noodles. But once you get out there, you'll be surprised how easy it is to navigate. That subway can take you everywhere you want to go; trains are frequent (though sometimes uncomfortably crowded) and almost always on time, and stations are well-signposted in English. That's not to say you won't occasionally find yourself frustratingly disorientated, but locals are generally eager to help you get back on track.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-173253572_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Japan,28,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,298184,"([('Meiji Jingu Shrine', 'Two, large gates frame the entrance to this Shinto shrine that was dedicated to Emperor and Empress Meiji.

7,amsterdam,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/amsterdam," Golden Age canals lined by tilting gabled buildings are the backdrop for Amsterdam's treasure-packed museums, vintage-filled shops and hyper-creative drinking, dining and design scenes. Amsterdam's canal-woven core is laced by atmospheric narrow lanes. You never know what you'll find: a tiny hidden garden; a boutique selling witty, stylised Dutch-designed homewares and fashion; a jewel-box-like jenever (Dutch gin) distillery; a flower stall filled with tulips in a rainbow of hues; an old monastery-turned-classical-music-venue; an ultra-niche restaurant such as an all-avocado specialist or one reinventing age-old Dutch classics. Fringing the centre, post-industrial buildings in up-and-coming neighbourhoods now house creative enterprises, from art galleries to craft breweries and cutting-edge tech start-ups, as well as some of Europe's hottest clubs. You can't walk a kilometre without bumping into a masterpiece in the city. The Van Gogh Museum hangs the world's largest collection by tortured native son Vincent. A few blocks away, Vermeers, Rembrandts and other Golden Age treasures fill the glorious Rijksmuseum. The Museum het Rembrandthuis offers more of Rembrandt via his etching-packed studio, while the Stedelijk Museum counts Matisses and Mondrians among its modern stock. And for blockbuster displays, the Hermitage Amsterdam delivers: the outpost of Russia's State Hermitage Museum sifts through its three-million-piece home trove to mount mega exhibitions. Two-wheeling is a way of life here. It's how Amsterdammers commute to work, go to the shop, and meet a date for dinner. Abundant bike-hire shops make it easy to gear up and take a spin. If locals aren't on a bike, they may well be on the water. With its canals and massive harbour, this city reclaimed from the sea offers countless opportunities to drift. Hop aboard a canal boat (preferably an open-air one) or one of the free ferries behind Centraal Station, or rent your own for a wind-in-your-hair ride. Amsterdam is famously gezellig, a Dutch quality that translates roughly as 'convivial' or 'cosy'. It's more easily experienced than defined. There's a sense of time stopping, an intimacy of the here-and-now that leaves your troubles behind, at least until tomorrow. The easiest place to encounter this feeling is a bruin café (brown cafe; traditional drinking establishment). Named for their wood panelling and walls once stained by smoke, brown cafes have gezelligheid (cosiness) on tap, along with good beer. You can also feel gezellig lingering after dinner in snug restaurants while the candles burn low.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-beautiful-amsterdam-76796579.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,The Netherlands,95,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,188590,"([('Rijksmuseum', ""The Rijksmuseum is the museum of the Netherlands.

8,cape-town,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-africa/cape-town," A coming-together of cultures, cuisines and landscapes, there's nowhere quite like Cape Town, a singularly beautiful city crowned by the magnificent Table Mountain National Park. Table Mountain National Park defines the city. The flat-topped mountain is the headline act, but there are many other equally gorgeous natural landscapes within the park’s extensive boundaries. Cultivated areas, such as the historic Company’s Garden, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden and Green Point Urban Park, also make exploring the city a pleasure. Follow the lead of locals by taking full advantage of the abundant outdoor space: learn to surf; go hiking or mountain biking; tandem-paraglide off Lion’s Head; abseil off the top of Table Mountain – just a few of the many activities on offer. Human creativity is also self-evident here – it's one of the things that made the city a World Design Capital in 2014. From the brightly painted facades of the Bo-Kaap and the bathing chalets of Muizenberg, to the Afro-chic decor of its restaurants and bars and the striking street art and innovation incubators of the East City and Woodstock, this is one great-looking metropolis. The informal settlements of the Cape Flats are a sobering counterpoint, but these townships also have enterprising projects that put food from organic market gardens on tables, or stock gift shops with attractive souvenirs. Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and traditional African beliefs coexist peacefully in this proudly multicultural city. Given South Africa’s troubled history, such harmony has been hard-won and remains fragile: nearly everyone has a fascinating, sometimes heartbreaking story to tell. It’s a city of determined pioneers – from the Afrikaner descendants of the original Dutch colonists and the majority coloured community to the descendants of European Jewish immigrants and more recent Xhosa (isiXhosa) migrants from the Eastern Cape. They all bring unique flavours to Cape Town’s rich melting pot. Wrenching yourself away from the magnetic mountain and all the delights of the Cape Peninsula is a challenge, but within an hour you can exchange urban landscapes for the charming towns, villages and bucolic estates of Winelands destinations, such as Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. Hermanus is a prime whale-watching location, and also a base from which to organise shark-cave diving. Further afield, the delights of the Garden Route unfold, with more inspiring scenery to be viewed on thrilling drives down the coast and over mountain passes.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-welcome-to-cape-town-104168527.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,South Africa,31,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,312659,"([('Table Mountain Aerial Cableway', ""The best views of Cape Town are seen from the top of Table Mountain.

9,san-francisco,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco," Grab your coat and a handful of glitter, and enter a wonderland of fog and fabulousness. So long, inhibitions; hello, San Francisco! Consider permission permanently granted to be outlandish: other towns may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself. Good times and social revolutions tend to start here, from manic gold rushes to blissful hippie 'be-ins'. If there's a skateboard move yet to be busted, a technology still unimagined, a poem left unspoken or a green scheme untested, chances are it's about to happen here. Yes, right now. This town has lost almost everything in earthquakes and dot-com gambles, but never its nerve. Every available Bay Area–invented technology is needed to make dinner decisions in this city, with the most restaurants and farmers markets per capita in North America – all supplied by pioneering local organic farms. San Francisco set the gold standard for Wild West saloons, until drinking was driven underground in the 1920s with Prohibition. Today San Francisco celebrates its historic saloons and speakeasies – and with Wine Country and local distillers providing a steady supply of America's finest hooch, the West still gets wild nightly. San Francisco is a 7-by-7-mile peninsula that looks like California's thumb, pointed optimistically upwards. Take this as a hint to look up: you'll notice San Francisco's crooked Victorian rooflines, wind-sculpted treetops, and fog tumbling over the Golden Gate Bridge. Microclimates add magic realism to San Francisco days: when it's drizzling in the outer reaches of Golden Gate Park, it might be sunny in the Mission. A difference of a few degrees between neighborhoods grants permission for salted-caramel ice cream in Dolores Park, or a hasty retreat to tropical heat inside the California Academy of Sciences' rainforest dome.

10,hong-kong,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/hong-kong," Hong Kong welcomes with an iconic skyline, a legendary kitchen, and lush, protected nature where rare birds and colourful traditions thrive. Hong Kong's enchanting neighbourhoods and islands offer a sensory feast. You may find yourself swaying along on a historic double-decker tram, cheering with the hordes at the city-centre horse races, or simply gazing out at the glorious harbour. What most visitors don't immediately realise is that over 70% of Hong Kong is mountains and sprawling country parks, some also home to geological and historical gems. Escape the city limits on one of the world’s smoothest transport systems and spend your day wandering in a Song dynasty village, hiking on a deserted island or kayaking among volcanic sea arches. One of the world's top culinary capitals, the city that worships the God of Cookery has many a demon in the kitchen, whether the deliciousness in the pot is Cantonese, Sichuanese, Japanese or French. So deep is the city's love of food and so broad its culinary repertoire that whatever your gastronomic desires, Hong Kong will find a way to sate them. The answer could be a bowl of wonton noodles, freshly steamed dim sum, a warm pineapple bun wedged with butter, a pair of the sweetest prawns, your first-ever stinky tofu, or the creations of the latest celebrity chef. From off-the-rack Chinese gowns to bespoke speciality knives (and vice versa), the sheer variety of products in Hong Kong’s shops is dizzying. Every budget, need and whim is catered for in 'can do' spirit by a similarly impressive assortment of venues: glitzy malls where the moneyed shop, chic side-street boutiques and vintage dens where fashionistas find their gems, nerdy gadget bazaars, and a mix of markets where you can haggle to your heart’s content. The city has no sales tax so prices are generally attractive to visitors. Underneath the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s commercial persona is a dynamic cultural landscape where its Chinese roots, colonial connections and the contributions of its home-grown talent become intertwined. Here you’re just as likely to find yourself dissecting art in the dizzying number of contemporary galleries as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music by the harbour or Chinese opera in a bamboo theatre, not to mention the thousands of shows staged year-round at the city's many museums and concert halls.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/b08817d7af62da7bd61cb72e5842d993029269e6f69750cc8d24351f6527105d.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,China,6.43,Level 4: Do Not Travel,294217,"([('Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha)', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/b5/cf/14/big-buddha.jpg'), ('Victoria Peak (The Peak)', ""Hong Kong's number one tourist destination features the Peak Tower and the Peak Tram, the city's oldest mode of public transport."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/c9/50/88/photo3jpg.jpg'), ('Star Ferry', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0d/65/9f/8f/star-ferry.jpg'), ('Ngong Ping 360', 'Ngong Ping Cable Car - the gateway to start your Lantau adventure in Hong Kong!

11,berlin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berlin," Berlin's combo of glamour and grit is bound to mesmerise all those keen to explore its vibrant culture, cutting-edge architecture, fabulous food, intense parties and tangible history. Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go. Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city's vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina! When it comes to creativity, the sky’s the limit in Berlin, which is one of Europe's big start-up capitals. In the last 20 years, the city has become a giant lab of cultural experimentation thanks to a spirit that nurtures and encourages new ideas as well as to once abundant space and cheap rent. Although the last two of these are definitely a thing of the past. Top international performers still grace Berlin's theatre, concert and opera stages; international art-world stars like Olafur Eliasson and Jonathan Meese make their home here; and Clooney and Hanks shoot blockbusters in the German capital. Highbrow, lowbrow and everything in between – there’s plenty of room for the full gamut of cultural expression. Berlin is a big multicultural metropolis but deep down it maintains the unpretentious charm of an international village. Locals and expats follow the credo 'live and let live' and put greater emphasis on personal freedom and a creative lifestyle than on material wealth and status symbols. Cafes are jammed at all hours, drinking is a religious rite and clubs keep going through the weekend into Monday. Size-wise, Berlin is pretty big but its key areas are wonderfully compact and easily navigated on foot, by bike or with public transport.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-475150263_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Germany,56,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187323,"([('Reichstag Building', 'Situated just north of the Brandenburg Gate, this building houses the German Parliament and was the seat of the Weimar Republic government until it was seized by the Nazis in 1933.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/26/0a/97/reichstag-from-the-gardens.jpg'), ('Memorial of the Berlin Wall', ""The Berlin Wall Memorial is the central memorial site of German division, located in the middle of the capital.

12,bangkok,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/bangkok," Same same, but different. This Thailish T-shirt philosophy sums up Bangkok, a city where the familiar and the exotic collide like the flavours on a plate of pàt tai. Until you’ve eaten on a Bangkok street, noodles mingling with your sweat amid a cloud of exhaust fumes, you haven’t actually eaten Thai food. It can be an intense mix: the base flavours – spicy, sour, sweet and salty – aren’t exactly meat and potatoes. But for adventurous foodies who don't need white tablecloths, there’s probably no better dining destination in the world. And with immigration bringing every regional Thai and international cuisine to the capital, it's also a truly diverse experience. And perhaps best of all, Bangkok has got to be one of the best-value dining destinations in the world. The language barrier here can seem huge, but it's never prevented anybody from getting along with the Thai people. The capital’s cultural underpinnings are evident in virtually all facets of everyday life, and most enjoyably through its residents' sense of fun (known in Thai as sà·nùk). In Bangkok, anything worth doing should have an element of sà·nùk. Ordering food, changing money and haggling at markets will usually involve a sense of playfulness – a dash of flirtation, perhaps – and a smile. Street Thai is as much emoted as it's spoken, and is actually not that difficult to learn. With so much of its daily life conducted on the street, there are few cities in the world that reward exploration as handsomely as Bangkok does. Cap off an extended boat trip with a visit to a hidden market. A stroll off Banglamphu’s beaten track can lead to a conversation with a monk. Get lost in the tiny lanes of Chinatown and stumble upon a Chinese opera performance. Or after dark, let the BTS (Skytrain) escort you to Sukhumvit, where the local nightlife scene reveals a cosmopolitan and dynamic city. It’s the contradictions that provide the City of Angels with its complex, multifaceted personality. Here, climate-controlled megamalls sit side by side with 200-year-old village homes; gold-spired temples share space with neon-lit strips of sleaze; slow-moving traffic is bypassed by long-tail boats plying the canals and riverways; Buddhist monks dressed in robes shop for the latest smartphones; and streets lined with food carts are overlooked by restaurants perched on top of skyscrapers. As Bangkok races towards the future, these contrasts are only poised to increase and intensify, even while supplying the city with its unique and ever-evolving notion of Thai cosmopolitanism.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/81d257161719d9da921211ddd8242449-bangkok.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Thailand,27.16,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,293916,"([('Wat Phra Chetuphon', 'One of the oldest and largest temples in Bangkok features the famous Reclining Buddha, which is the largest in Thailand measuring more than 150 feet in length.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1b/13/12/e4/img-20190421-104113-largejpg.jpg'), ('Temple Of Dawn (Wat Arun)', 'This temple is considered to be the most famous and photographed temple in Bangkok, which features a soaring 70-meter-high spire decorated with tiny pieces of colored glass and Chinese porcelain.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/fc/3d/ec/yd3c0254-largejpg.jpg'), ('Chatuchak Weekend Market', 'Chatuchack Weekend Market is indoor and outdoor market, Also known as JJ Market was reached a landmark status as a must-visit place for tourists.

13,chicago,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/chicago," Steely skyscrapers, top chefs, rocking festivals – the Windy City will blow you away with its low-key cultured awesomeness. It's hard to know what to gawk at first. High-flying architecture is everywhere, from the stratospheric, glass-floored Willis Tower to Frank Gehry's swooping silver Pritzker Pavilion to Frank Lloyd Wright's stained-glass Robie House. Whimsical public art studs the streets; you might be walking along and wham, there's an abstract Picasso statue that's not only cool to look at, but you're allowed to go right up and climb on it. For art museums, take your pick: impressionist masterpieces at the massive Art Institute, psychedelic paintings at the midsized Museum of Mexican Art or outsider drawings at the small Intuit gallery. Loosen your belt – you've got a lot of eating to do. On the menu: peanut-butter-and-banana-topped waffles for breakfast (at Stephanie Izard's Little Goat), pork-shoulder posole and garlicky yucca enchiladas for lunch (at Dove's Luncheonette) and fine dining on foraged foods for dinner (at Iliana Regan's Elizabeth). You can also chow down on a superb range of global eats from Vietnamese pho to Mexican carnitas, Polish pierogi and Macanese fat rice. Still hungry? Order a late-night deep-dish pizza or seek out a hot and spicy Italian beef sandwich at a local fast-food joint. Chicago is a maniacal sports town, with a pro team for every season (two teams, in baseball's case). Watching a game is a local rite of passage, whether you slather on the blue-and-orange body paint for a Bears football game, join the raucous baseball crowd in Wrigley Field's bleachers, or plop down on a bar stool at the neighborhood tavern for whatever match is on TV. Count on making lots of spirited new friends. Should the excitement rub off and inspire you to get active yourself, the city's 26 beaches and 580 parks offer a huge array of play options. Chicago knows how to rock a festival. Between March and September it throws around 200 shindigs. The specialty is music. Blues Fest brings half a million people to Millennium Park to hear guitar notes slide and bass lines roll, all for free. During the four-day Lollapalooza megaparty, rock bands thrash while the audience dances in an arm-flailing frenzy. Smaller, barbecue-scented street fests take place in the neighborhoods each weekend – though some rival downtown for star power on their stages (oh, hey, Olivia Newton-John at Northalsted Market Days).",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-466204117_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,35805,"([('The Art Institute of Chicago', 'See why the Art Institute of Chicago is the only museum in the world to be top-ranked by TripAdvisor four years in a row!

14,shanghai,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/shanghai," Shanghai: few cities in the world evoke so much history, excess, glamour, mystique and exotic promise in name alone. Shanghai is home to the world's second-tallest tower and a host of other neck-craning colossi. But it's not all sky-scraping razzmatazz. Beyond the crisply cool veneer of the modern city typified by Pudong, you can encounter copious architectural styles. The city's period of greatest cosmopolitan excess – the 1920s and 1930s – left the city with splendid examples of art deco buildings, most of which survived the vicissitudes of the 20th century. And there's more: from Jesuit cathedrals, Jewish synagogues and Buddhist temples to home-grown lòngtáng (laneway) and shíkùmén (stone gate) housing, Shanghai’s diverse architectural heritage is like no other city's on earth. Thirty years ago, Shanghai's dour restaurant scene was all tin trays and scowling wait staff, with international food confined to 'exclusive' hotels. Today, the seriously good restaurant scene is varied, exciting and up-to-the-minute. Shanghai got its own Michelin dining guide in 2017, proving just how far the city has come. Food is the hub of Chinese social life, and it's while eating that people catch up, celebrate and clinch business deals. Inevitably, some of your best memories here will be culinary. Do as the Shanghainese do and make a meal of it. Bearing in mind that Chinese shoppers constitute up to 46% of the global luxury-goods market, shopping is rarely done in half-measures in Shanghai. Retail therapy is one way of spending new money and the Shanghainese aren't called 小资 (xiǎozī – 'little capitalists') by the rest of China for nothing, especially at the luxury end of things. But it's not all Prada, Gucci and Burberry. There are pop-up boutiques, bustling markets, cool vintage shops and young designer outlets. Beyond clothing, you're spoiled for choice, whether you're in the market for antiques, ceramics, art, jewellery… whatever is on your shopping list. Beijing often hogs the limelight as China’s cultural nexus, but for a town of wheelers and dealers, Shanghai is surprisingly creative. Many art galleries are exciting, offering a window into contemporary Chinese concerns, while nightlife options have exploded. Acrobatics shows are always a tourist favourite and you might grab the chance to catch some Chinese opera. Shanghai’s music and club scenes are vibrant: from unpretentious jazz and indie venues to all-night hip-hop and electro-dance parties, the city swings with the best of them.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/d0b15fd7b08219f82cd5ad7a580421b4-shangh-i.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,China,6.43,Level 4: Do Not Travel,308272,"([('The Bund (Wai Tan)', 'This is a designated section of Shanghai’s port along the Huang Pu River lined with beautiful neo-classical buildings and a waterfront promenade that is packed with tourists, locals and street sellers.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/cc/fc/09/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Shanghai Tower', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/b7/80/4d/captivating.jpg'), ('Oriental Pearl Tower (Dongfang Mingzhu)', 'Speed to the top of the world’s third tallest TV and radio tower for a spectacular view, or just gaze at this beautiful structure from afar, especially striking when lit up at night.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/ad/ed/f1/m-on-the-bund.jpg'), ('Yu Garden (Yuyuan)', 'A classical garden complete with period style buildings.

15,barcelona,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/barcelona," Barcelona is an enchanting seaside city with boundless culture, fabled architecture and a world-class drinking and dining scene. Barcelona's architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals. In other parts of town bloom the sculptural masterpieces of Modernisme, a mix of ingenious and whimsical creations by Gaudí and his Catalan architectural contemporaries. Barcelona has also long inspired artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, both of whom have major Barcelona museums devoted to their works. The masters of molecular gastronomy – Albert Adrià, Carles Abellan et al – are part of the long and celebrated tradition of Catalan cooking. Simple, flavourful ingredients – seafood, jamón (cured ham), market-fresh produce – are transformed into remarkable delicacies and then served in captivating settings. Feast on hearty, rich paella at an outdoor table overlooking the sea or step back to the 1920s at an elegant art nouveau dining room. Barcelona's wide-ranging palate adds further complexity: Basque-style tapas bars, Galician seafood taverns, avant-garde Japanese restaurants and sinful chocolate shops are all essential parts of the culinary landscape. The deep blue Mediterranean beckons. Sun-drenched beaches make a fine backdrop to a jog, bike ride or long leisurely stroll along the seaside – followed by a refreshing dip. You can also enjoy the view from out on the water while kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding or taking it easy on a sunset cruise. Looming behind the city, the rolling forest-covered Collserola hills provide a scenic setting for hiking, mountain biking or just admiring the view. Closer to the city centre, hilltop Montjuïc offers endless exploring amid botanic and sculpture gardens, an old castle and first-rate museums with panoramic views at every turn. The night holds limitless possibilities in Barcelona. Start with sunset drinks on a panoramic terrace or dig your heels in the sand at a rustic beachside chiringuito (temporary snack bar). As darkness falls, live music transforms the city: the rapid-fire rhythms of flamenco, brassy jazz spilling out of basements, and hands-in-the-air indie-rock at vintage concert halls. Towards midnight the bars fill. Take your pick from old-school taverns adorned with 19th-century murals, plush lounges in lamp-lit medieval chambers or boisterous cava bars. If you're still standing at 3am, hit the clubs and explore Barcelona's unabashed wild side.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/a8c85359c17fe06bd67dc3e834259514-barcelona.jpeg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Spain,22,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187497,"([('Basilica of the Sagrada Familia', 'The Basilica of the Sagrada Familia is a monumental church devoted to the Holy Family: Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

16,melbourne,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/melbourne," Equal parts dynamic, cosmopolitan, sports-mad and arty, Melbourne simultaneously exudes style and keeps its best spots hidden, inviting discovery by food and culture lovers. Melbourne is often dubbed the most 'European' of Australian cities – indeed the eastern, designer section of Collins St was crowned the 'Paris End' in the 1950s. There's also a mini New York vibe here, thanks to the city's well-ordered grid and scattering of art-deco high-rises. But Melbourne is uniquely Melbourne, too. Much of that is due to the 230-plus laneways that penetrate into the heart of city blocks, which are recognised for world-class street art, restaurants and bars. Spend a year here – or a lifetime – and there will still be another route to take; another gem to uncover. While central Melbourne has its own allure, the city's charm lies in its diverse suburbs, each of which tells a different tale. Despite the long-standing north–south divide (glitzy South Yarra versus hipster Fitzroy), there’s an effortless, laid-back appeal surrounding Melbourne's bars, cafes, festivals and people that transcends borders. Best experienced like a local, neighbourhood pockets of delicious food reflect the ethnic communities that inhabit them: Victoria St, Richmond, for Vietnamese; Carlton's old-school Italian; Balaclava for Jewish bakeries; Middle Eastern in Brunswick; Footscray for Ethiopian; and Chinatown for Asian food matched only by its country of origin. It's not the high-rises and bridges that strike you when first visiting Melbourne, but the vast sporting edifices on the fringe of the city centre. Melburnians are crazy about AFL football ('footy'), cricket and horse racing, while grand-slam tennis and Formula One car racing draw visitors in droves. Sport is part of the social fabric and takes on something of a religious aspect here. In fact, sporting events have nearly as many public holidays allotted to them as religion – everyone gets the day off for the Melbourne Cup horse race and the Friday before the AFL Grand Final! It’s easy to label Melbourne a 'hipster' destination, but for a city that’s more than 20 hours by plane from New York and London – and home to half as many people – it’s more a trendsetter than follower. Melbourne's long been food and coffee obsessed and had liberal, bohemian and progressive strands to its subculture. Top chefs are inspired by their heritage and don't just cook local produce, but native ingredients used by Indigenous Australians for hundreds of thousands of years. Mingled with hotspots in laneways, warehouses and on rooftops, it’s clear that Melbourne doesn't have to try – it just is.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-88658327_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Australia,97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,255100,"([('Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria', ""Visit Melbourne's inner-city oasis.

17,rio-de-janeiro,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/rio-de-janeiro," Golden beaches and lush mountains, samba-fueled nightlife and spectacular football matches: welcome to the Cidade Maravilhosa (Marvelous City). Looking out from the 710m peak of Corcovado, you will see why Rio is called the Cidade Maravilhosa. Lushly forested mountains fringe the city, shimmering beaches trace the shoreline and a string of tiny islands lie scattered along the seafront. Far from being mere cinematic backdrop, this seaside beauty hosts outstanding outdoor adventures: hiking in the Tijuca rainforest, cycling alongside the lake and beaches, sailing across Baía de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay), and surfing, rock climbing and hang gliding amid one of the world's most stunning urban landscapes. Rio's beaches have long seduced visitors. Copacabana Beach became a symbol of Rio during the 1940s, when international starlets would jet in for the weekend. Hogging the spotlight these days is Ipanema Beach, its fame and beauty unabated since bossa nova stars Tom Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes introduced the world to its allure in the 1960s. For cariocas (residents of Rio), the beach is Rio's backyard – a playground that's free and open to all, offering endless enjoyment in the form of football, volleyball, surfing, snacking, drinking or simply relaxing amid the passing parade of people. Music is Rio's lifeblood, and the city's soundtrack comprises rock, old-school bossa nova, hip-hop, funk and Brazil's many regional styles. Above all there's samba, a rapid-fire style of music with African influences and an infectious beat that is synonymous with Rio. You can hear it all over town, but the soul of samba resides in Lapa, an edgy red-light district that's home to dozens of live-music halls and an enormous weekend street party that draws revelers from all walks of life. Samba is also the integral sound during Carnaval, and the danceable backing music to street parties and all-night parades. Speaking of Carnaval, Rio knows how to party. Whether you call it joie de vivre, Lebensfreude or lust for life, cariocas have it in spades. Carnaval, and the buildup to it, is the most obvious manifestation of this celebratory spirit. But Rio has many other occasions for revelry: celebrations after a big Flamengo (or Vasco, Fluminense or Botafogo) soccer match; weekend samba parties around town; baile funk parties in the favelas (slums, informal communities); and boat parties on the bay – not to mention major fests such as Réveillon (New Year's Eve) and the Festas Juninas.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-rio-sunset-74908701.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Brazil,5,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,303506,"([('Sugarloaf Mountain', 'One of the most beautiful attractions in Rio de Janeiro and one of the most famous in Brazil.

18,vancouver,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/vancouver," Explorable neighborhoods, drink-and-dine delights and memorable cultural and outdoor activities framed by striking natural vistas – there's a superfluity of reasons to fall for this ocean-fringed metropolis. Don't tell the rest of the country but Vancouver is Canada’s dine-out capital. Abandon your diet and dive right into North America's best Asian cuisine, from chatty Chinese restaurants to Vietnamese banh mi sandwich joints, or unleash your appetite on a rich smorgasbord of fresh-caught local seafood, including seasonal spot prawns and succulent wild salmon. The farm-to-table movement has also reinvigorated West Coast cuisine here – anyone for Fraser Valley lamb with a side of foraged morels? And we haven't even started on Vancouver’s thirst-slaking craft-beer scene, pouring the nation’s finest IPAs, sours and more. Downtown is just the start of Vancouver. Walk or hop public transit and within minutes you'll be hanging with the locals in one of the city's diverse and distinctive mini-districts. Whether discovering the independent boutiques of Main St or the coffee shops of Commercial Dr, the redbrick bars of Gastown or the heritage-house beachfronts of Kitsilano, you'll find this city ideal for easy-access urban exploration. Just be sure to chat to the locals wherever you go: they might seem shy or aloof at first, but Vancouverites love talking up their town and regaling you with their personal recommendations. There's a multi-textured canvas of creativity to pore over in this city. Dig deeply and you'll find an eclectically diverse grassroots scene that operates like a locavore movement for culture fans. Mingle with the regulars at indie festivals, sparkling theatrical events, toe-tapping live music, waterfront Shakespeare shows and a camera-ready menagerie of eye-popping public art. There’s also a savor-worthy menu of independent galleries, a large public gallery that’s about to break-ground on a grand new building, and a huge, party-like open-house art crawl that lures locals and visitors every November. Those snow-capped giants peeking at you from between downtown's glass towers? They're less than 30 minutes away by car. Vancouverites really can ski in the morning and hit the beach in the afternoon – although it's far more relaxing to chill out and take your time. The city's North Shore nature doorstep offers snow sports, mountain biking and rainforest hiking trails, while the city itself is studded with sandy shorelines, kayaking routes, verdant gardens and Canada's urban green-space jewel, the mighty and highly beloved Stanley Park.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/72423ed05ba070876112620724440230-vancouver.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Canada,86.21,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,154943,"([('Stanley Park', ""North America's third-largest park draws eight million visitors per year, many of whom may skate or walk past you on the Seawall, a scenic, 5.5-mile path running along the water on the park's perimeter.

19,st-petersburg,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/st-petersburg," The sheer grandeur and history of Russia's imperial capital never fail to amaze, but this is also a city with a revolutionary spirit. The creation of westward-looking Peter the Great, St Petersburg was intended from its inception as a display of imperial Russia’s growing status in the world. Fine-tuned by Peter’s successors, who employed a host of European architects to add fabulous palaces and cathedrals to the city’s layout, St Petersburg grew to be the Romanovs’ showcase capital and Russia’s first great, modern city. The capital may have moved back to Moscow following the revolution, but despite all that history has thrown at it, St Petersburg still feels every bit the imperial city with its historic heart largely frozen in time. Whether you’re cruising along the elegant canals, crossing one of the 342 bridges in the city, or just watching them being raised in summer over the mighty Neva River at night to allow ships to pass through, you’re never far from water in St Petersburg. This has earned the city unsurprising comparisons to Venice, but the similarities don’t stop there: walking around the historic centre will reveal canals lined by Italianate mansions and broken up by striking plazas adorned with baroque and neoclassical palaces. North of the city centre there are also pristine beaches fringing the Gulf of Finland. St Petersburg is an almost unrivalled treasure trove of art and culture. You can spend days in the Hermitage, seeing everything from Egyptian mummies to Picassos, while the Russian Museum, spread over four sumptuous palaces, is perhaps the best collection of Russian art in the world. Add to this world-class ballet, opera and classical concerts at the illustrious performance halls, and a slew of big-name music festivals over the summer months, and you won’t be stuck for cultural nourishment. Contemporary art is also available at the fantastic Erarta Museum, the Street Art Museum and in the buzzing gallery scene. Summer White Nights are legendary: the northern sun barely dips below the horizon. Revelry begins in May, with parks and gardens greening with flowering trees, and peaks in mid-June when performing arts festivals pack out concert halls and the entire city seems to party all night long. It's the busiest time to visit and the crowds can often be overwhelming. But Piter, as the city is affectionately known, is just as beautiful in early spring, golden autumn and even winter: the skies may be leaden and the ground covered in snow, but the culture still dazzles and delights.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-canals-of-st-petersburg-82408857.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Russia,5.48,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,298507,"([('The State Hermitage Museum', ""One of the most famous art museums in the world, this museum is housed in the Winter Palace, and contains over 2.7 million exhibits including some of the world's greatest works of art."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/83/ff/2a/es-casi-imposible-tomar.jpg'), ('Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood', 'Built to memorialize Alexander II following his assassination in 1881, this magnificent church with Italian pink marble floors and numerous mosaics was modeled after 16th and 17th century churches, contrasting sharply with the prevailing architectural styles.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/60/a4/29/renkli.jpg'), ('Grand Peterhof Palace', ""Once a formal garden built for Peter the Great, this popular park still has more than 80 of the original marble statues and sculptures and houses Peter's Summer Palace, a simply designed two-story building that now displays many of the ruler's own artifacts."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/a3/d4/30/a-20-30-km-de-saint-petersbour.jpg'), ('Catherine Palace and Park', 'Filled with 18th-century paintings and ornate rooms, this white and gold palace is surrounded by a 1400-acre park complete with fountains, bridges, the Agate Pavilion bathhouse and the Great Pond.

20,beijing,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/beijing," From ancient walled capital to showpiece megacity in barely a century, Beijing (Běijīng, 北京), spins a breathless yarn of triumph, tragedy, endurance and innovation. Capital of China since Kublai Khan came a-knocking (with a hundred thousand Mongol horsemen behind him), Beijing has hosted the last three imperial dynasties: the Yuan (Mongols), the Ming (Han Chinese) and the Qing (Manchu). Hutong, the city's residential alleyways, are a Mongolian legacy. The Forbidden City? Hat-tip to the Ming. Summer Palace? The Qing. Nor does it stop there. Chairman Mao slumbers in Tian'anmen Square, hallowed turf for the Communist Party of China. And over it all loom giants like the 528m CITIC Tower, which topped out in 2018. What next for this restive superpower? You're about to find out... In Beijing, chī le ma? (have you eaten?) is literally how locals greet their neighbours. Food is the glue that binds all Beijingren, no matter their beliefs or bank balance. Whether you're slurping noodles, queuing for jiānbing, or guiltily rolling just one more Peking duck pancake, you're in good company. A mouth-watering melting pot, Beijing hosts exotic regional cuisines from across China, which equates to unbridled adventure for foodies. And all that icky stuff: dogs, snakes, bugs? That’s all down south. Beijingren don't go in for any of that tripe. Although they do love actual tripe, dipped in sesame sauce! From Peking opera troupes to world-class contemporary art, Beijing draws on a profound well of creativity, and that's despite the vagaries of censorship. To give the government its due, museums are more numerous than ever, curation is less prescriptive and innovation is at an all-time high. China's finest universities feed Zhongguancun, the 'Silicon Valley' of Beijing, which is making seismic waves with its breakthroughs in AI and Big Data. At the humbler end, post-punk bands drone away in divey livehouses, local DJs get the hands in the air, while old folks still warble the revolutionary songs in the city parks. Undisputed party capital – the Communist Party, that is – Beijing is a uniquely micromanaged megacity, a showpiece where the State's latest schemes are piloted to the populace. 'Xi Jinping Thought' is the guiding mantra (Xi being China's prez for the foreseeable future). When Beijing needs to get things done, it gets things done. Air pollution? Improving year on year. Winter Olympics in a snowless city? No problemo. Country-wide surveillance? Easy-peasy. The world's biggest airport, Daxing, was ready to open at time of research, as ever more bullet trains race outwards to the provinces. All in a day's work for Beijing.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-556891639_high.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,China,6.43,Level 4: Do Not Travel,294212,"([('Mutianyu Great Wall', 'In 1368 AD, Mutianyu Great Wall was built by Xu Da who is the main general for Zhuyuanzhang in the Great Wall ruins of Northern Qi Dynasty.

21,budapest,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/hungary/budapest," Budapest has something for everyone – from dramatic history and flamboyant architecture to healing thermal waters and a nightlife that is unrivalled in Eastern and Central Europe. Budapest’s beauty is not all God given; humankind has played a role in shaping this pretty face too. Architecturally, the city is a treasure trove, with enough baroque, neoclassical, Eclectic and art nouveau buildings to satisfy everyone. Overall, though, Budapest has a fin de siècle feel to it, for it was then, during the capital’s ‘golden age' in the late 19th century, that most of what you see today was built. They say the past is another country, but it’s always been just around the corner in Budapest. Witness the bullet holes and shrapnel pockmarks on buildings from WWII and the 1956 Uprising. There are sad reminders like the poignant Shoes on the Danube memorial, but ones, too, of hope and reconciliation – like the 'sword' of the former secret-police building on Andrássy út now beaten into the 'ploughshare' that is the House of Terror, with both sides of the story – left and right – told. There's a lot more to Hungarian food than goulash, and it remains one of the most sophisticated styles of cooking in Eastern and Central Europe. Magyars may exaggerate when they say that there are three essential world cuisines – French, Chinese and their own. But Budapest’s reputation as a food capital dates largely from the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century and, despite a fallow period under communism, the city is once again commanding attention. So, too, are Hungary's excellent wines – from Eger's complex reds and Somló’s flinty whites to honey-sweet Tokaj. Budapest is blessed with an abundance of hot springs. As a result, ‘taking the waters’ has been an experience here since the time of the Romans. The array of bathhouses is generous – you can choose from Turkish-era, art nouveau and modern establishments. Some people come seeking a cure for whatever ails them, but the majority are there for fun and relaxation – though we still maintain it’s the world’s best cure for what Hungarians call a macskajaj (cat’s wail) – hangover.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-budapest-at-night-part-iii-76226665.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Hungary,20,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,274887,"([('Hungarian Parliament Building', 'The domed neo-Gothic structre was inspired by the British House of Parliament and serves as both a vibrant government center and a proud city landmark on the banks of the Danube.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/1d/7a/7c/parliament.jpg'), ('Halaszbastya', 'Built during the 19th century for the Hungarian Millennium celebrations, this mock bastion features pointed towers and turrets, reminiscent of the fairytale castles in Disney World.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/85/8a/b7/fisherman-s-bastion.jpg'), (""St. Stephen's Basilica (Szent Istvan Bazilika)"", 'Built between 1851 and 1905, this large parish church accommodates 8,500 people and features a magnificent 300-foot, neo-Renaissance dome.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/98/36/84/side-view-of-saint-stephens.jpg'), ('Danube River', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/cc/8c/bb/danube-river.jpg'), ('Buda Castle', 'Destroyed by fire in World War II, this imposing 13th-century palace was rebuilt with modern interiors while incorporating hidden walls and medieval structures that remained hidden over the centuries.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/5d/4a/ff/img-20180204-225332332.jpg'), ('Shoes on the Danube Bank', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/b2/fb/3b/shoes-on-the-danube-promenade.jpg'), ('Margaret Island (Margitsziget)', 'Quiet walkways, flower gardens, romantic ruins and century-old trees make up this popular recreation spot located in the heart of Budapest.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/dc/ab/4f/20160904-112802-largejpg.jpg'), ('Gellert Hill', 'The best views of Budapest and the Danube River are from this hill, which also features the imposing fortress, the Citadella, at its summit.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/09/4f/cc/7d/gellert-hill-and-statue.jpg'), ('Szechenyi Chain Bridge', ""Completed in 1849, this bridge was the first to be built across the Hungarian section of the Danube and is now considered to be one of the city's major landmarks."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/1c/bd/90/uncover-hungary-s-shining.jpg'), ('Matthias Church', 'Used over the centuries as a coronation church for the Hungarian kings, the slender and graceful architecture of this beautiful church dominates the main square of the Castle area.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/c2/f8/f2/bucket-list-de-budapeste.jpg'), ('Varhegy', 'Lovingly restored after being reduced to rubble during World War II, this picturesque area is located in the heart of medieval Budapest, which is characterized by cobblestone streets, narrow alleys and lovely squares surrounded by baroque and classical buildings.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/8c/8b/15/20171213-163711-largejpg.jpg'), ('Budapest Pinball Museum', ""Hungary's first and Europe's largest continuously operating interactive pinball exhibition with unlimited trial of more than 130 pinball machines."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/e4/85/75/budapest-pinball-museum.jpg'), (""Heroes' Square"", ""A large square constructed in 1896 for the millennium of the Magyar Conquest of Hungary.

22,seattle,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/seattle," Blink and it’s changed: Seattle can be that ephemeral. Welcome to a city that heralds innovation and nature; a city always marching toward the future. First time in Seattle? Make a beeline for its proverbial pantry: Pike Place Market. It was founded in 1907 to fortify locals with fresh Northwest produce, and its long-held mantra of ‘meet the producer’ still echoes enthusiastically around a city where every restaurateur worth their salt knows the name of their fishmonger and the biography of the cow that became yesterday’s burgers. It doesn’t take long to realize that you’ve arrived in a city of well-educated palates and wildly experimental chefs who are willing to fuse American cuisine with just about anything – as long as it’s local. Visitors setting out to explore Seattle should think of the city as a United States of Neighborhoods or – to put it in more human terms – a family consisting of affectionate but sometimes errant members. There’s the aloof, elegant one (Queen Anne), the social butterfly (Capitol Hill), the artistic, bearded one (Fremont), the effortlessly cool one (Ballard), the grizzled old patriarch (Pioneer Square), the precocious adolescent still carving out its identity (South Lake Union) and the one who lives out of town (West Seattle). You’ll never fully understand Seattle until you’ve spent a bit of time with them all. To outsiders, Seattle is an industrious creator of macro-brands. To insiders, it’s a city of micro-businesses and boundary-pushing grassroots movements. For proof, dip into the third-wave coffee shops, the microbreweries with their casual tasting rooms or the cozy informal bookstores that remain rock solid in a city that spawned Amazon. Then there are the latest national trends that Seattle has helped popularize: craft cider, weed dispensaries, specialist pie-makers, vegan ice cream that's actually good, and chic donuts, to name a few. Hit the streets and you'll see there’s far more to this city than Starbucks, Nordstrom and Boeing. Seattle's current reputation as the town that spawned Amazon and Starbucks won't give you the full picture of the city's oddball cultural heritage. Crisscross its urban grid and you’ll find all kinds of apparitions: a rocket sticking out of a building; a museum built to resemble a smashed-up electric guitar; glass orbs in wooden canoes; a statue of Lenin; a mural made of used chewing gum; fish-tossing market traders; and a museum dedicated to antique pinball machines (that you can still play). Need help acclimating? The city's still-booming legal weed market will help you embrace your own weird side.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/c6470f3f3be651f3b1b18e487835b7b6624e2916ea740a1531df6005025a3633.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,60878,"([('Chihuly Garden and Glass', ""Located in the heart of Seattle, Chihuly Garden and Glass provides a look at the inspiration and influences that inform the career of artist Dale Chihuly.

23,venice,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/venice," Imagine the audacity of building a city of marble palaces on a lagoon – and that was only the start. Never was a thoroughfare so aptly named as the Grand Canal, reflecting the glories of centuries of Venetian architecture in the 50 palazzi and six churches lining its banks. At the end of Venice’s signature S-shaped waterway, the Palazzo Ducale and Basilica di San Marco add double exclamation points. But wait until you see what’s hiding in the narrow backstreets: neighbourhood churches lined with Veroneses and priceless marbles, convents graced with ethereal Bellinis, Tiepolo’s glimpses of heaven on homeless-shelter ceilings, and a single Titian painting that mysteriously lights up an entire basilica. Garden islands and lagoon aquaculture yield speciality produce and seafood you won’t find elsewhere – all highlighted in inventive Venetian cuisine, with tantalising traces of ancient spice routes. The city knows how to put on a royal spread, as France’s King Henry III once found out when faced with 1200 dishes and 200 bonbons. Today such feasts are available in miniature at happy hour, when bars mount lavish spreads of cicheti (Venetian tapas). Save room and time for a proper sit-down Venetian meal, with lagoon seafood to match views at canalside bistros and toasts with Veneto’s signature bubbly, prosecco. Pity the day trippers dropped off at San Marco with a mere three hours to take in Venice. That’s about enough time for one long gasp at the show-stopper that is Piazza San Marco, but not nearly enough time to see what else Venice is hiding. Stay longer in this fairy-tale city and you’ll discover the pleasures of la bea vita (the beautiful life) that only locals know: the wake-up call of the gondoliers' ‘Ooooeeeee!’, a morning spritz in a sunny campo (square), lunch in a crowded bacaro (bar) with friends and fuschia-pink sunsets that have sent centuries of artists mad. Eyeglasses, platform shoes and uncorseted dresses were all outlandish Venetian fashions that critics sniffed would never be worn by respectable Europeans. Venetians are used to setting trends, whether it be with controversial artwork in the Punta della Dogana, racy operas at La Fenice or radical new tech start-ups challenging Silicon Valley giants. On a smaller scale, this unconventional creative streak finds vibrant expression in the showrooms of local artisans where you can find custom-made red-carpet shoes, purses fashioned from silk-screened velvet, and glass jewels brighter than semiprecious stones. In a world of cookie-cutter culture, Venice’s originality still stands out.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-535829619_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Italy,34,Level 3: Reconsider Travel,187870,"([(""Doge's Palace"", 'A masterpiece of Gothic architecture, the building and its sculptural decoration date from various periods.

24,vienna,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/vienna," Baroque streetscapes and imperial palaces set the stage for Vienna's artistic and musical masterpieces alongside its coffee-house culture and vibrant epicurean and design scenes. Vienna's imperial grandeur is the legacy of the powerful Habsburg monarchy. Their home for more than six centuries, the Hofburg palace complex, incorporates the Burgkapelle (Imperial Chapel), where the Vienna Boys' Choir sings Sunday Mass, and the famed Spanish Riding School, where Lipizzaner stallions perform elegant equine ballet, along with a trove of museums, including in the chandeliered Kaiserappartements (Imperial Apartments). Other immense palaces include the baroque Schloss Belvedere and the Habsburgs' 1441-room summer residence, Schloss Schönbrunn, while 19th-century splendours such as the neo-Gothic Rathaus (City Hall) line the magnificent Ringstrasse encircling the Innere Stadt (inner city). One of the Habsburgs' most dazzling Rinsgstrasse palaces, the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, houses the imperial art collection. It's packed with priceless works by Old Masters, and treasures including one of the world's richest coin collections. Behind the Hofburg, the former imperial stables have been transformed into the innovative MuseumsQuartier, with a diverse ensemble of museums, showcasing 19th- and 20th-century Austrian art at the Leopold Museum to often-shocking avant-garde works at the contemporary MUMOK. Meteorites, fossils and prehistoric finds fill the Naturhistorisches Museum, while exquisite furnishings at the applied-arts Museum für Angewandte Kunst are also among the artistic feasts in store. With a musical heritage that includes composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Johann Strauss (father and son), Johannes Brahms and Gustav Mahler, among countless others, Vienna is known as the City of Music. Its cache of incredible venues where you can catch performances today include the acoustically renowned Musikverein, used by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the gold-and-crystal main opera house, the Staatsoper, and the multistage Konzerthaus, as well as the dedicated home of the Vienna Boys' Choir, MuTh. Music comes to life through interactive exhibits at the captivating Haus der Musik museum. The Viennese appreciation of the finer things in life extends to its opulent coffee-house 'living rooms' serving spectacular cakes; its beloved pub-like Beisln dishing up hearty portions of Wiener schnitzel, Tafelspitz (prime boiled beef) and goulash; elegant restaurants; and its fine Austrian wines served in vaulted Vinothek (wine bar) cellars, and in rustic vine-draped Heurigen (wine taverns) in the vineyards fringing the city.

25,dublin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ireland/dublin," A small capital with a huge reputation, Dublin has a mix of heritage and hedonism that will not disappoint. All you have to do is show up. Dublin has been in the news since the 9th century, and while traces of its Viking past have been largely washed away, the city is a living museum of its history since then, with medieval castles and cathedrals on display alongside the architectural splendours of its 18th-century heyday, when Dublin was the most handsome Georgian city of the British Empire and a fine reflection of the aspirations of its most privileged citizens. How power was wrested from their hands is another story, and you'll learn that one in its museums and on its walking tours. Dubliners will admit theirs isn't the prettiest city, but will remind you that pretty things are as easy to like as they are to forget…before showing you the showstopper Georgian bits to prove that Dublin has a fine line in sophisticated elegance. True love is demonstrated with brutal unsentimentality round here, but they'll go soft at the knees when talking about the character and personality of the 'greatest city in the world, if you ignore all the others'. Garrulous, amiable and witty, Dubliners at their ease are the greatest hosts of all, a charismatic bunch with compelling soul and sociability. Even in these times of green juices and heart-monitoring apps, the pub remains the alpha and omega of social interaction in Dublin. The city's relationship with alcohol is complex and conflicted but, at its very best, a night out in the pub is the perfect social lubricant and one of the highlights of a visit to Dublin. Every Dubliner has their favourite haunt, from the never-changing traditional pub to whatever new opening is bringing in the beautiful people. With more than 1000 of them spread about the city, you'll be spoilt for choice. For as long as it's been around, Dublin has looked beyond Irish shores for inspiration. Once the second city of the (British) Empire, Dublin has always maintained a pretty cosmopolitan outlook and in the last three decades has conspicuously embraced diversity and multiculturalism. You'll hear languages and eat foods from all four corners of the globe, and while it used to be said that ‘real’ Dubs had to be born within the canals like their parents and grandparents before them, these days you’re just as likely to meet a Dub whose parents were born in Warsaw, Lagos, Cairo or Beijing.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/79954195.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Ireland,98.37,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,186605,"([('Jameson Distillery Bow St.', ""Since John Jameson's brave first steps into this building in 1780, we've been focused on his ambition to create unforgettable experiences (along with great whiskey, of course).

26,madrid,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/madrid," Madrid is a beguiling place with an energy that carries one simple message: this city really knows how to live. Few cities boast an artistic pedigree quite as pure as Madrid’s: many art lovers return here again and again. For centuries, Spanish royals showered praise and riches upon the finest artists of the day, from home-grown talents such as Goya and Velázquez to Flemish and Italian greats. Masterpieces by these and other Spanish painters such as Picasso, Dalí and Miró now adorn the walls of the city’s world-class galleries. Three in particular are giants – the Museo del Prado, Centro de Arte Reina Sofía and Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza – but in Madrid these are merely good places to start. Rising above the humble claims of its local cuisine, Madrid has evolved into one of the richest culinary capitals of Europe. The city has wholeheartedly embraced all the creativity and innovation of Spain’s gastronomic revolution. But this acceptance of the new is wedded to a passion for the enduring traditions of Spanish cooking, for the conviviality of the eating experience and for showcasing the infinite variety of food from every Spanish region. From tapas in sleek temples to all that’s new to sit-down meals beneath centuries-old vaulted ceilings, eating in Madrid is a genuine pleasure. Madrid nights are the stuff of legend, and the perfect complement to the more sedate charms of fine arts and fine dining. The city may have more bars than any other city on earth – a collection of storied cocktail bars and nightclubs that combine a hint of glamour with non-stop marcha (action). But that only goes some way to explaining the appeal of after-dark Madrid. Step out into the night-time streets of many barrios and you’ll find yourself swept along on a tide of people, accompanied by a happy crowd intent on dancing until dawn. Madrid may lack the cachet of Paris, the monumental history of Rome, or Barcelona’s reputation for Modernista masterpieces. And no, there is no equivalent of the Eiffel Tower, Colosseum or La Sagrada Família that you can point to and say ‘this is Madrid’. But Madrid has nothing to be envious of. Spain's broad sweep of architectural history provides a glorious backdrop to city life, from medieval mansions and royal palaces to the unimagined angles of Spanish contemporary architecture, from the sober brickwork and slate spires of Madrid baroque to the extravagant confections of the belle époque. Put simply, this is one beautiful city.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/9d06864e1a551111cd5115d0310489a8-madrid.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Spain,22,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187514,"([('Prado National Museum', 'The Prado has one of the largest art collections in the world, and is best known for its diverse assortment of works by Velasquez, Goya and El Greco.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/0e/96/e6/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('CentroCentro Cibeles', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/d2/65/ae/palacio-de-comunicaciones.jpg'), ('Parque del Retiro', 'Peaceful urban park centered around a beautiful lake.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/53/53/2c/img-20160729-205021-largejpg.jpg'), ('Santiago Bernabeu Stadium', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/a6/b3/b6/photo4jpg.jpg'), ('Estadio Vicente Calderon', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0d/3f/e5/b1/stadio.jpg'), ('Royal Palace of Madrid', 'Luxurious, over-the-top rococo palace with over 2,000 opulently gilded rooms.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/af/ca/4f/caption.jpg'), ('Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza', 'The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum offers visitors an overview of art from the 13th century to the late 20th century.

27,lisbon,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbon," Seven cinematic hillsides overlooking the Rio Tejo cradle Lisbon's postcard-perfect panorama of cobbled alleyways, ancient ruins and white-domed cathedrals – a captivating scene crafted over centuries. Dining in Lisbon is far more dynamic than navigating countless preparations of Portugal's beloved bacalhau (dried and salted cod fish; 365 recipes and counting!). While bacalhau à Brás (shredded cod with onions, eggs and potatoes; a Bairro Alto original) is never far, Lisbon's strategic seaside position on Europe's doorstep means a bounty of fresh seafood (octopus, tuna, monkfish, shrimp, sardines, clams, snails) rules the city's kitchens, from Michelin-starred restaurants to gourmet-food markets to countless corner tascas (taverns). Top-grade Alentejan beef beckons with juicy steaks and gourmet burgers, and you'll find everything from tantalising Indian curries to authentic Moroccan couscous in between. Cheap booze and the absence of open-container laws means Lisbon loves a night on the town! Don't be fooled by Bairro's Alto's sleepy daytime feel – by night, these narrow cobbled lanes transform into one of Europe's most raucous drinking locales. Student dives, traditional fado houses, upscale wine bars and LGBT hot spots merrily coexist among the muddled mess. In Cais do Sodré, Pink Street and environs are home to some of the city's classic nightclubs and rowdiest cocktail bars, while trendier megaclubs stretch along the waterfront from Santos to Santa Apolónia. Last call? Sunrise! You couldn't blame your average lisboêta for thinking of the Apocalypse when the ground gave way just before 10am on 1 November, 1755. What followed was eight astonishing minutes of city-shattering shaking spread across three tremors, followed 40 minutes later by a massive, city-engulfing tsunami, culminating in a week-long firestorm that incinerated what little was initially spared. Lisbon was decimated. Today, the modern city is shaped by these cataclysmic events – nearly everything is defined as before or after the earthquake – and the Pombaline architecture that defined post-quake Lisbon reconstruction was some of the first seismically protected building in Europe.

28,prague,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/czech-republic/prague," Prague is the equal of Paris in terms of beauty. Its history goes back a millennium. And the beer? The best in Europe. The 1989 Velvet Revolution that freed the Czechs from communism bequeathed to Europe a gem of a city to stand beside stalwarts such as Rome, Paris and London. Not surprisingly, visitors from around the world have come in droves, and on a hot summer's day it can feel like you’re sharing Charles Bridge with half of humanity. But even the crowds can’t take away from the spectacle of a 14th-century stone bridge, a hilltop castle and a lovely, lazy river – the Vltava – that inspired one of the most hauntingly beautiful pieces of 19th-century classical music, Smetana’s Moldau symphony. Prague's art galleries may not have the allure of the Louvre, but Bohemian art offers much to admire, from the glowing Gothic altarpieces in the Convent of St Agnes, to the luscious art nouveau of Alfons Mucha, and the magnificent collection of 20th-century surrealists, cubists and constructivists in the Veletržní Palác. The weird and witty sculpture of David Černý punctuates Prague's public spaces, and the city itself offers a smorgasbord of stunning architecture, from the soaring verticals of Gothic and the exuberance of baroque to the sensual elegance of art nouveau and the chiselled cheekbones of cubist facades. The best beer in the world just got better. Since the invention of Pilsner Urquell in 1842, the Czechs have been famous for producing some of the world's finest brews. But the internationally famous brand names – Urquell, Staropramen and Budvar – have been equalled, and even surpassed, by a bunch of regional Czech beers and microbreweries that are catering to a renewed interest in traditional brewing. Never before have Czech pubs offered such a wide range of brews – names you'll now have to get your head around include Kout na Šumavě, Primátor, Únětice and Matuška. Prague's maze of cobbled lanes and hidden courtyards is a paradise for the aimless wanderer, always beckoning you to explore a little further. Just a few blocks away from the Old Town Square you can stumble across ancient chapels, unexpected gardens, cute cafes and old-fashioned bars with hardly a tourist in sight. One of the great joys of the city is its potential for exploration – neighbourhoods such as Vinohrady and Bubeneč can reward the urban adventurer with countless memorable cameos, from the setting sun glinting off church domes, to the strains of Dvořák wafting from an open window.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-prague-fireworks-2015-5-114339723.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Czech Republic,27,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,274707,"([('Prague Zoo', 'Prague Zoological Garden is situated near the center of the Czech capital, in a unique rugged landscape on the bank of the Vltava River.

29,moscow,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/moscow," During any season, at any hour of the day, Moscow thrills visitors with its artistry, history and majesty. The very founding site of the city (and arguably, the country), the Kremlin and Red Square are still at the heart of Moscow – historically, geographically and spiritually. Feel the weight of this significance as you wander within the walls of the ancient fortress, marvel at the mind-boggling magnificence of St Basil's Cathedral and pay your respects to the revered leader of a now-defunct state. Moscow will move you. It will tantalise your senses, soothe your spirit and boggle your mind – and it all starts right here at the Kremlin and Red Square. The remains of the Soviet state are scattered all around the city. Monuments remember fallen heroes and victorious battles, while museums attempt to analyse and synthesise the past. See Lenin and Stalin – off their pedestals – at the whimsical Art Muzeon. Step into the socialist-realist fantasy at VDNKh. Descend into the depths of the Soviet system at Bunker-42 Cold War Museum. Ride the museum-like metro and remember the millions who suffered at the Gulag History Museum. Nowadays, retro clubs and cafes give their guests a taste of the Soviet experience. You can even try your hand at Soviet-era arcade games. What is more thrilling than watching a ballerina defy gravity, leaping across the stage at the glittering Bolshoi Theatre? Or feeling the force of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, just a few blocks away from where it premiered more than a century ago? Or oohing and aahing as circus performers soar under the big tent? The classical performing arts in Moscow are still among the best in the world. Nowadays, even the most traditional theatres are experimenting with innovative arrangements, reviving lost favourites and hosting world premieres. Whether you appreciate the classics or prefer the contemporary, the capital's performing arts will impress. At nearly every turn in Moscow, you'll see golden domes peeking out over the rooftops and hear church bells peeling through the streets, which are dotted with some 600 churches – many of which are glittering after recent renovations. There are colourful hidden gems, historic fortresses and gargantuan cathedrals. The exteriors are adorned with stone carvings and glittering domes; interiors are packed with ancient icons, swirling incense and faithful worshippers. For more than a millennium, Orthodoxy has helped to define the Russian nation, a significance that is palpable in these atmospheric spiritual places.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-sunrise-61786861.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Russia,5.48,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,298484,"([(""Saint Basil's Cathedral"", 'Built by Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, this intriguing cathedral bordering Red Square consists of nine separate chapels, each capped with its own individually shaped and colored dome.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/37/20/ab/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('State Tretyakov Gallery', 'The State Tretyakov Gallery is the national treasury of Russian fine art and contains more than 180,000 works of painting, sculpture and graphics created by generations of Russian artists.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/46/7c/b5/caption.jpg'), ('Moscow Metro', ""Riding the city's underground subway system is a sightseeing tour in itself with huge, vaulted, marble-columned stations - some with ornate mosaics and splendid stained glass - designed and decorated by famous Russian architects and sculptors."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/c4/f2/62/estacion-con-sus-pinturas.jpg'), ('Moscow Kremlin', ""Moscow's most famous historical and political landmark, the Kremlin is a walled-in complex of cathedrals, palaces and government offices, with several buildings open to the public, including the Armoury, Patriarch's Palace and the State Kremlin Palace."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/9c/41/55/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Red Square', ""Red Square is a city square in Moscow, Russia.

30,dubai,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/united-arab-emirates/dubai," Dubai is a stirring alchemy of profound traditions and ambitious futuristic vision wrapped into starkly evocative desert splendour. It's hard not to admire Dubai for its indefatigable verve, ambition and ability to dream up and realise projects that elsewhere would never get off the drawing board. This is a superlative-craving society that has birthed audaciously high buildings and palm-shaped islands. Sci-fi concepts such as flying taxis, a lightning-fast Hyperloop train and an army of robocops are all reflections of a mindset that fearlessly embraces the future. With many more grand projects in the pipeline for World Expo 2020, it's clear that Dubai is a city firmly in charge of writing its own narrative. Dubai is a top retail haunt that hosts not one but two huge annual shopping festivals. Shopping is a leisure activity here, and malls are much more than just mere collections of stores. Some look like an Italian palazzo or a Persian palace and lure visitors with surreal attractions such as an indoor ski slope, a giant aquarium or an open-air botanical garden. Traditional souqs, too, are beehives of activity humming with timeless bargaining banter. Meanwhile, a new crop of urban-style outdoor malls has expanded the shopping spectrum yet again. After dark, Dubai sometimes seems like a city filled with lotus eaters, forever on the lookout for a good time. Its shape-shifting party spectrum caters for just about every taste, budget and age group. From flashy dance temples, sleek rooftop terraces and sizzling beach clubs to fancy cocktail caverns, shisha lounges and concerts under the stars, Dubai delivers hot-stepping odysseys. Most of the nightlife centres on the fancy hotels, but there’s no shortage of more wholesome diversions either, including community theatre, live-music venues and the world-class Dubai Opera. The first Middle Eastern city to make the Unesco list of creative cities of design, Dubai is a bustling microcosm peacefully shared by cultures from all corners of the world. This diversity expresses itself in the culinary landscape, fashion, music and performance. Although rooted in Islamic tradition, this is an open society where it’s easy for newcomers and visitors to connect with myriad experiences, be it eating like a Bedouin, dancing on the beach, shopping for local art or riding a camel in the desert. Dubai is a fertile environment conducive to breaking down cultural barriers and preconceptions.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-540039747_full.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Arab Emirates,45,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,295424,"([('Burj Khalifa', 'Described as both a ‘Vertical City’ and ‘A Living Wonder,’ Burj Khalifa, developed by Dubai-based Emaar Properties PJSC, is the world’s tallest building.

31,kuala-lumpur,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/kuala-lumpur," A skyline punctuated by minarets, Mogul-style domes and skyscrapers; colourful, food-stall-lined streets shaded by a leafy canopy of banyan trees – this is Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia’s sultry capital is a feast for all the senses. Here you'll find historic monuments, steel-clad skyscrapers, lush parks, megasized shopping malls, bustling street markets and lively nightspots. Today's KL-ites are separated by barely a handful of generations from the tenacious Chinese and Malay tin prospectors who founded the city, carving it out of virgin jungle. By the time the British made it the capital of Peninsular Malaysia in the late 19th century, erecting grand colonial buildings, KL had only been in existence for a couple of decades. To fully connect with locals, join them in two of their favourite pastimes: shopping and eating. Malaysian consumer culture achieves its zenith in KL, where you could spend all day browsing glitzy air-conditioned malls such as Pavilion KL, Suria KLCC and Mid Valley Megamall in search of designer fashion and bargains. Bangsar and Publika are the places to go for local labels and the work of offbeat independent designers. Alternatively, explore Central Market for locally made souvenirs and handicrafts; and hunt out the few remaining artisans and antiques dealers still keeping shop in and around Chinatown. Despite the heat, this is a city best explored on foot. Walk and you can catch all the action and save yourself the frustration of becoming entangled in one of KL's all-too-frequent traffic jams. Walking, you'll discover parts of KL retain the laid-back ambience and jungle lushness of the kampung (village) it once was. What's more, you'll be sure to come across some of the city's best dining spots: the hawker stalls and traditional neighbourhood kopitiam (coffee shops) that beckon you over with the aroma of freshly cooked food and the promise of refreshment with tropical juices and cooling drinks.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-485196605_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Malaysia,60,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,298570,"([('Petronas Twin Towers', ""No trip to KL would be complete without a visit to the world's tallest twin towers.

32,istanbul,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul," This magical meeting place of East and West has more top-drawer attractions than it has minarets (and that's a lot). İstanbul's strategic location has attracted many marauding armies over the centuries. The Greeks, Romans and Venetians took turns ruling before the Ottomans stormed into town and decided to stay – physical reminders of their various tenures are found across the city. The fact that the city straddles two continents wasn't its only drawcard – it was the final stage on the legendary Silk Road linking Asia with Europe, and many merchants who came here liked it so much that they, too, decided to stay. In so doing, they gave the city a cultural diversity that it retains to this day. The conquering armies of ancient times tended to ransack the city rather than endow it with artistic treasures, but all that changed with the Byzantines, who adorned their churches and palaces with mosaics and frescoes. Miraculously, many of these remain. Their successors, the Ottomans, were quick to launch an ambitious building program and the magnificently decorated imperial mosques that resulted are architectural triumphs that together form one of the world's great skylines. In recent years, local banks and business dynasties have reprised the Ottomans' grand ambitions and endowed an impressive array of galleries, museums and festivals for all to enjoy. 'But what about the food?' we hear you say. We're happy to report that the city's cuisine is as diverse as its heritage, and delicious to boot. Locals take their eating and drinking seriously – the restaurants here are the best in the country. You can eat aromatic Asian dishes or Italian classics if you so choose, but most visitors prefer to sample the succulent kebaps, flavoursome mezes and freshly caught fish that are the city's signature dishes, washing them down with the national drink, rakı (aniseed brandy), or a glass or two of locally produced wine. Some ancient cities are the sum of their monuments, but İstanbul factors a lot more into the equation. Chief among its manifold attractions are the locals, who have an infectious love of life and generosity of spirit. This vibrant, inclusive and expanding community is full of people who work and party hard, treasure family and friendships, and have no problem melding tradition and modernity in their everyday lives. Joining them in their favourite haunts – çay bahçesis (tea gardens), kahvehans (coffeehouses), meyhanes (Turkish taverns) and kebapçıs (kebap restaurants) – will be a highlight of your visit.

33,montreal,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal," Witness a French-infused city that's in love with festivals, the arts, good food, living well and enjoying life to the hilt. Blessed with one of the most exciting food scenes in North America, Montréal brims with temples dedicated to Kamouraska lamb, Arctic char and, of course, poutine (fries smothered in cheese curds and gravy). You’ll find irresistible patisseries, English pubs, 80-plus-year-old Jewish delis and magnificent food markets reminiscent of Paris. There are hipster bars with tiny bowling alleys, vegetarian options galore and innumerable cafes in which to while away a lazy afternoon. And there are late-night eateries where you can linger over wondrous combinations of food and drink that you'll find nowhere else on earth. Toronto may be Canada’s economic capital, but Montréal remains the country’s cultural juggernaut. The city, standard bearer of an entire linguistic-cultural identity – francophone Canada – simply lives for public celebration of the arts. There are some 250 theater and dance companies, more than 90 festivals and a fascinating medley of neighborhoods where artists, writers and musicians have helped cement the city’s reputation as a great arts center. The Festival International de Jazz de Montréal is the headline event, followed by parties dedicated to world cinema, comedy and gay pride. Montréal is a slice of old Europe in a pie of contemporary design. A day’s wander might take in the photogenic 18th-century facades of Old Montréal before a cycling tour of the lovely Canal de Lachine, or a wander through the glittering shops and restaurants of downtown before ending at the inviting terraced cafes of Plateau Mont-Royal. The architectural sweep of the city takes in a wealth of heritage churches such as the breathtaking Basilique Notre-Dame, as well as 20th-century icons like the Stade Olympique and Habitat 67. Montréal's hotels and museums additionally push the edges of contemporary interior design. The Québécois love their summers and autumnal colors, but it is the winter that defines much of their lives, which slow down and become more insular in the grip of those long, dark months. With that said, the passion for life that animates Canadian francophones does not truly dim in the cold, but is rather celebrated around cozy fireplaces, in friendly pubs, at steaming sugar shacks, and, of course, on the slopes of local mountains via skis, snowboards and toboggans.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-sunrise-87597293.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Canada,86.21,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,155032,"([('Mount Royal Park', ""Inaugurated in 1876, the Mount Royal Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the highly skilled designer behind New York's Central Park.

34,buenos-aires,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/argentina/buenos-aires," Buenos Aires combines faded European grandeur with Latin passion. Sexy and alive, this beautiful city gets under your skin. BA's food scene is increasingly dynamic, but for many travelers it's the city's carnivorous pleasures that shine. Satisfying a craving for juicy steaks isn't hard to do in the land that has perfected grilling wonderfully flavorful sides of beef, washed down with a generous glass of malbec or bonarda. Parrillas (steakhouses) sit on practically every corner and will offer up myriad cuts, from bife de chorizo (sirloin) to vacio (flank steak) to ojo de bife (rib eye). But leave room for ice cream, if you can – a late-night cone of dulce de leche (caramel) helado can't be topped. Look closely: this city is beautiful. Sure, it might look like a concrete jungle from certain angles, but stroll through the streets, paying attention to the magnificent architecture around you, and you'll soon be won over. Grand French- and Italian-style palaces grab the limelight, but you'll see interesting architectural details in the buildings of even low-key, local barrios. These days the beauty of these traditional neighborhoods is further enhanced by colorful murals painted by artists involved in the city's vibrant street-art scene. For these talented individuals, the city is their canvas. Take a disco nap, down some coffee and be prepared to stay up all night – this city doesn't sleep. Restaurants get going at 9pm, bars at midnight and clubs at 2am at the earliest; serious clubbers don't show up until 4am. And it's not just the young folk who head out on the town in this city; BA's diverse range of bars, clubs and live-music venues offers something for everyone, from DJs spinning electronica to live jazz sets. Just remember you'll be doing it all very late. BA's famous dance is possibly the city's greatest contribution to the outside world, a steamy strut that's been described as 'making love in the vertical position'. Folklore says it began in the bordellos of long-ago Buenos Aires, when men waiting for their 'ladies' passed time by dancing among themselves. Today, glamorized tango shows are supremely entertaining with their grand feats of athleticism. You'll also find endless venues for perfecting your moves, from milongas (dance salons) to dance schools. Be aware that some people become addicted – and can spend a lifetime perfecting this sensual dance.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/4c410251e0146b2edd2b8b1d64a02047-buenos-aires.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Argentina,6.52,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,312741,"([('Teatro Colon', 'The Teatro Colon, in the City of Buenos Aires, is considered one of the best theaters in the world.

35,athens,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/athens," With equal measures of grunge and grace, Athens is a heady mix of ancient history and contemporary cool. The magnificent Acropolis, visible from almost every part of the city, is the hub around which Athens still revolves. This temple city, built in the 5th century BC, serves as a daily reminder to Greeks of their heritage and the city's many transformations. All over the urban basin, rooftops and balconies angle toward the landmark, a block of milky marble atop a steep-sided hill. Pull up your own chair, settle in and allow time to appreciate the Acropolis' many moods, as the light shifts and the clouds cast their shifting shadows. The cultural and social life of Athens plays out amid, around and in landmarks that are centuries old, if not millennia. The remnants of Ancient Greece get the most attention, of course, thanks to a little thing called democracy. Oh, and mythology, and drama, and philosophy. But don't overlook the 'later' years: thousand-year-old Byzantine churches, for instance, which squat, unruffled in the middle of streets and attached to hillsides. Ottoman traces can be seen in architecture and in food. And the neoclassical style of the 19th century adds elegance all over the centre. Although Athenians have endured difficult circumstances since the start of the economic crisis in 2009, the city as a whole crackles with energy in art shows, political debates and even on the walls of derelict buildings, as Athens has become one of Europe's most noted spots for street art. Creative surprises lie around nearly every corner, so be sure to leave room in your schedule for spontaneous discovery: buy a ticket to that dance show that's just starting as you walk by, or sit down at the restaurant where the musicians are setting up. You'll be rewarded. Beyond Athens, down the Attica peninsula, are more spectacular antiquities, such as the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion and the site of Ancient Eleusis, as well as very good beaches, such as those near historical Marathon. Sure, you could zip across, west to east, in less than an hour, but it's far more fun to take a leisurely road trip to a thermally heated lake, say, or a monastery with dazzling Byzantine mosaics. If you'd rather not drive, most of these surprise sights (including great beaches) can be reached on public transport.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-88786323_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Greece,51,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,189400,"([('Acropolis', 'The most famous site in all of Athens, this large hill lies in the center of the city and contains a cluster of ancient ruins.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/11/7d/24/6a/acropolis-hill.jpg'), ('Acropolis Museum', 'Modern, uptodate building on the foot of the Acropolis housing important ancient Greek statues and much more', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/da/40/5f/caption.jpg'), ('Avenue of Poseidon (Poseidornos)', 'An urban street lined with restaurants, bars and clubs: a nightlife hot spot.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/0e/3a/cf/a6/near-the-sea.jpg'), ('National Archaeological Museum', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/06/45/a6/ae/museo-arqueologico-nacional.jpg'), ('Parthenon', 'The majestic ruins of an ancient Greek building, known for its dignified white marble columns and perfect sense of proportion.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/a5/1c/96/20171231-123343-largejpg.jpg'), ('Plaka', 'Historic neighborhood located at the base of the hill topped by the Acropolis.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/54/eb/04/20190129-115247-largejpg.jpg'), ('Mount Lycabettus', 'Walk or take the funicular tramway to the top of this hill for the best views of Athens', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0f/ba/e7/2c/le-mount-lycabettus.jpg'), ('Panathenaic Stadium', 'The Old Olympic Stadium in Athens Greece, built of granite in late 19th century on the site of ancient Athens from the 4th Century; hosted the first modern games in1896.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/d4/b3/6d/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Herod Atticus Odeon', 'Second-century theater built into the hillside.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/6b/f0/ce/20190316-113138-largejpg.jpg'), ('Philopappos Hill', 'This hill is a favorite for weekending Athenians who come here to picnic and admire the breathaking views.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f0/ed/d0/filopappos-hill.jpg'), ('Ancient Agora of Athens', 'These ruins, located in the heart of modern Athens, were once the site of the marketplace in ancient times, a political, cultural and economic center of the ancient world.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/ee/71/57/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Temple of Hephaestus', 'This ancient Greek temple, located on the Acropolis and dedicated to Hephaistos, god of the forge, is one of the few temples to be almost entirely preserved.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/0f/83/54/templo-de-hefesto.jpg'), ('Anafiotika', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/9b/ea/05/anafiotika-is-a-hidden.jpg'), ('Benaki Museum', 'The Benaki Museum is among the most extensive and innovative cultural organizations in Europa.

36,miami,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/miami," Beautiful beaches and art deco delights are just some of Miami’s many charms – there's also the blazing nightlife, tropical gardens, lively arts scene and sizzling cuisine. Even if there was no beach, Miami would still have undeniable allure. The gorgeous 1930s hotels lining Ocean Dr are part of the world’s greatest collection of art deco buildings. Tropical motifs, whimsical nautical elements and those iconic pastel shades create a cinematic backdrop for exploring the streets of Miami Beach. Of course, you don’t have to see these architectural beauties at arm’s length. Lavishly restored, Miami’s art deco and mid-century modern hotels are also the playground for locals and out-of-towners alike, with sunny poolside terraces, artfully designed dining rooms and plush nightclubs. Chalk it up to Miami’s diverse population, or perhaps its love of always being on the cutting edge. Whatever the reason, creativity is one of the great hallmarks of this city. From art and design to global cuisine, Miami remains ever on the search for bold new ideas, which manifest themselves in surprising ways. You’ll find brilliantly inventive chefs blending Eastern and Western cooking styles, sustainably designed buildings inspired by South Florida ecosystems and open-air galleries where museum-quality artwork covers once-derelict warehouses. The one constant in Miami is its uncanny ability to astonish. When the sun sets and the brilliant colors of a South Florida sunset fill the sky, that’s when the best part of the day begins for Miami’s party people. By moonlight, all the magic of the city unfolds, in its salsa-filled dance halls, swanky candlelit lounges, and rooftop bars with sweeping views over Biscayne Bay and the glittering city skyline. While there’s plenty of bling on display, Miami has something for all, from backyard bars full of indie rockers to hidden dens of debauchery concealed behind neon-lit taco stands. Few cities are as blessed as Miami when it comes to natural beauty. White sandy beaches are lapped by teal waters – perfect for sunrise strolls along peaceful stretches of Mid-Beach to scenic paddles in search of manatees off Virginia Key. You can look for colorful bird species while walking the trails of Oleta River State Park, or go to any of the tropical gardens across the city.

38,las-vegas,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/las-vegas," An oasis of indulgence in the desert, Vegas' seduction is hypnotic. The Strip shimmers with promise; like all mirages, though, reality doesn't reflect the veneer. There are few places outside London, Tokyo and New York where you're this spoiled for choice when it comes to A-list entertainers and big-budget stage shows. Seasonal casino residencies by the megastars of the music world range from next-gen pop divas Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani and Cardi B, to dad rockers Journey and Aerosmith, to the superstar DJs of the dance music universe, Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki and Tiësto. Top that with seven enthralling Cirque du Soleil shows, the mesmerizing Blue Man Group and magicians Penn & Teller, and you've got a pretty full schedule. The volume and concentration of the Strip's celebrity chefs, lauded fine-dining restaurants and America's favorite food franchises is hard to fathom: it's impossible to sample them all, in terms of time taken to savor the spectrum of flavors and the depth of the average visitor's wallet. If you're a foodie on a pilgrimage, we suggest you do your research and narrow your selection before you arrive, lest you be overwhelmed by the scope of what's on offer, or unable to secure a reservation in the short duration of your stay. You'll definitely want to save room for dessert. In this 24/7 city where it's possible to spend your entire visit in labyrinthine indoor worlds where artificial lighting mimics day passing into night, many visitors won't wander far from their expensive accommodations, lavish pool bar, mesmerizing casino floor, or even pulsing dance floor. The wise and well-informed, however, (that's you!) will venture off the Strip to experience the spectacular scenic beauty surrounding Las Vegas (after all, vega is 'meadow' in Spanish). Forged by tectonics, carved by the wind and baked by the desert sun, vast canyons and plains, epic mountains and alpine forests beckon you to trade humanity's distractions for nature's warm embrace. Those who enjoy life's finer details flock to Vegas to lap up the luxuries of the world's biggest and boldest high-end hotels. With price tags hovering around $300 per night for a sumptuous standard room at Encore, Cosmopolitan or Delano and starting at $1000 per night for a decadent SkyLoft at MGM Grand, $3500 for a Sky Villa at Aria then skyrocketing to a reputed $35,000 for the privilege of occupying Nobu Hotel's exclusive Nobu Villa, Vegas' 150,000+ hotel rooms offer something for every possible taste, ranging in quality and style from the sublime to the ridiculous.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-173148949_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,45963,"([('Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area', 'Visitors can admire colorful rock formations on several hiking trails or on a 13-mile scenic drive.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/05/cc/87/df/red-rock-canyon-national.jpg'), ('High Roller', ""Measuring 520 feet in diameter, the High Roller eclipses both the London Eye and Singapore Flyer.

39,new-delhi,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/delhi," Steeped in history yet overflowing with modern life, colourful, cacophonous Delhi pulsates with the relentless rhythms of humanity like few other cities on Earth. Honk-honk-beeeep! Welcome to Old Delhi. Love or hate it, it's impossible to ignore. Whether you make it your base, or just dip into it for shopping sprees or to see the Red Fort, you'll be hard pushed to ever forget your time in this wonderfully chaotic, and fabulously photogenic corner of the city. You'll be sharing its hectic streets and alleys with carts and cycle-rickshaws, with cows and monkeys, with shoppers and with beggars, with street-food sellers and market traders, and with cars, vans, scooters and autorickshaws; watch your back – honk-honk-beeeep! As the capital city of one of the most delicious country's on Earth, Delhi tantalises your taste buds with its thali-like fusion of flavours from every corner of the subcontinent: Breakfast on South Indian idly; lunch on Punjabi kulchas; then, come evening, dine on rich Mughlai curries. But don't forget to leave room for some Dilli-ka-Chaat, Delhi's famously delicious street-food snacks; try sizzling kebabs for starters, then munch on aloo tikki (spiced potato patties) before getting your fingers sticky on jalebi (orange-coloured coils of deep-fried batter dunked in sugar syrup) or savouring some sumptuously creamy cardamon kheer (rice pudding). All the riches of India twinkle in Delhi's emporiums, so if you're regretting not buying that handmade kathputli (puppet) you saw in Rajasthan or that Madhubani painting you loved in Bihar, fear not; chances are you'll be able to find one here too. New Delhi's emporiums are multi-floor, gift-filled markets that are perfect for a last-minute souvenir binge before you fly home. Old Delhi's famously frenetic street bazaars, meanwhile, contain a mind-boggling array of clothes, slippers, shawls, handicrafts, food, electronics and more – even if you're not buying anything, they're a joy to visit (and photograph). Delhi is a city built upon cities. There are at least eight historical Delhis, each constructed on, or near, the ruins of its predecessor, leaving a modern-day citadel that's dotted with ancient monuments, many said to be haunted by djinns (spirits). Love history and you'll be left salivating as you trace your way through the eras, clambering across the ruined forts of Tughlaqabad, Siri, Purana Qila and Shajahanabad; exploring the magnificent tombs of eminent historical figures; and visiting the still-vibrant temples, mosques and shrines that throng with devotees today, as they have done for hundreds of years.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/c6efedc2e8ed8cd2c461bae21da8ca70-delhi.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,India,12.18,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,304551,"([('Qutub Minar', 'Construction on this sandstone minaret was begun in 1192.

40,philadelphia,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pennsylvania/philadelphia," Blessed with the glamour and culture of a big city, 'Philly' as it's affectionately known, also delights visitors with its rich history and small-town charm. Declared a World Heritage City by Unesco in 2015, Philadelphia was at the heart of US colonial and revolutionary history. Founded by British Quaker William Penn in the late 17th century, the 'City of Brotherly Love' cherishes and protects its earliest days within the Independence National Historical Park of the Old City. Visiting original institutions such as Independence Hall and the seeing iconic landmarks like the Liberty Bell will help you appreciate the deep passion for freedom that motivated the new nation's founders. Excellent museums devoted to the Constitution, the American Revolution and Benjamin Franklin round out that education. By the late 19th century Philly had evolved into the 'Workshop of the World.' Its industries generated abundant wealth, which funded large construction projects, including City Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, and filled cultural storehouses such as the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Penn Museum. Experiments in architecture and social policy resulted in buildings like Eastern State Penitentiary, while philanthropist Dr Albert C Barnes built up an astounding collection of art for public consumption. This spirit of civic pride and sharing continues in contemporary projects such as Isaiah Zagar's Philadelphia's Magic Gardens. In the 20th century the city slipped into economic decline, but nothing lasts forever and while some areas of Philly remain blighted, urban beautification and neighborhood regeneration projects, such as the marvelous Mural Art Program, have transformed the city into a dazzling outdoor gallery of street art. The glory of Philly's early days is preserved in the redbrick terraces of Society Hill through to the areas around the hallowed campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Sprawling Fairmount Park ensures nature and greenery are both within easy access, and the bicycle and jogging paths of the Schuylkill River Trails are prime urban resources. Eating is a highlight here, with two of the city's most loved attractions – Reading Terminal Market and the South 9th Street Italian Market – placing food front and center. The city's culinary scene is nothing if not democratic, embracing everything from artisan pizza and vegan creations to the blue-collar heartiness of a cheesesteak sandwich or a soft, salty pretzel. Philly's ethnic and cultural diversity is also reflected on the plate: in one day you could tuck into an Amish breakfast, lunch on spicy Asian noodles and enjoy Mexican tacos for dinner.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/f75fa2794dfaf9db8824bb227539c670-philadelphia.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,60795,"([('Eastern State Penitentiary', 'Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site was once the most famous and expensive prison in the world, but stands today in ruin, a haunting world of crumbling cellblocks and empty guard towers.

41,milan,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/milan," Milan is Italy’s city of the future, a fast-paced metropolis where money talks, creativity is big business and looking good is an art form. Ruled by the Caesars, Napoléon, the Austro-Hungarians and Mussolini, Milan has an ancient and fascinating history. After the unification of Italy in 1861, it also became an important industrial and cultural centre – a title it still holds today. While it may not have the historic attractions of other Italian cities, it holds its own with art collections old and new, which mark the genius of old masters and provoke new conversations about where the world is headed. Prestigious nights at La Scala, an illustrious literary heritage and a vibrant music scene also do much to debunk the city's workaholic image. Since Leonardo da Vinci broke all the rules in his stunning Last Supper, the indefatigably inventive Milanese seem to have skipped straight from the Renaissance to the 1900s. Not only is Milan a treasure trove of 20th-century art, but art deco and rationalist architecture abound. Today the city leads the way with the largest post-war re-development in Italy, impressive, sustainable architecture and a futuristic skyline modelled by Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and César Pelli. The city is also burgeoning into a hi-tech hub, home to start-ups galore and the likes of Google, Microsoft, Alibaba and Apple. Though Italian design is world renowned, its roots lie in 1930s Milan – seeing it in a home context offers fresh appreciation. A visit to the Triennale design museum is a wonderful way to pay homage to the work of Italy’s best and brightest. In addition, Milan is home to all the major design showrooms and an endless round of trade fairs, including Salone Internazionale del Mobile and its ever-popular sidekick the free Fuorisalone. Italian fashion houses are also branching out into spas, bars, hotels, galleries and cultural centres all over Milan, which means you can get your style fix pretty much everywhere. Cucina povera (poor man's cuisine) may be the cry of the south, but Milanese cooking is the product of a rich urban culture. Just note the golden hue of its quintessential dishes: cotoletta (burnished, buttery veal) and saffron risotto. It was in powerful commercial cities such as Milan that some of Italy’s great cuisines were born, marrying Mediterranean fruits, spices and herbs with cooking methods, pastry techniques and eating styles from France and central Europe. Even today Milan continues to push Italy’s culinary boundaries, making sushi and dim sum its own, and holding the highest number of Michelin stars in the country.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/stock-photo-milano-66092441.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Italy,34,Level 3: Reconsider Travel,187849,"([('Duomo di Milano', ""The Duomo, symbol of Milan in the world, is one of the largest cathedrals in Italy and Europe.

42,florence,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/florence," Cradle of the Renaissance, romantic, enchanting and utterly irresistible, Florence (Firenze) is a place to feast on world-class art and gourmet Tuscan cuisine. Few cities are so compact in size or so packed with extraordinary art and architecture masterpieces at every turn. The urban fabric of this small city, on the banks of the Arno river in northeastern Tuscany, has hardly changed since the Renaissance and its narrow cobbled streets are a cinematic feast of elegant 15th- and 16th-century palazzi (palaces), medieval candle-lit chapels, fresco-decorated churches, marble basilicas and world-class art museums brimming with paintings and sculptures by Botticcelli, Michelangelo et al. Unsurprisingly, the entire city centre is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Italy's fashion industry was born and bred here. Homegrown designers Guccio Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo opened haute-couture boutiques in Florence in the 1920s and shopping in the Tuscan capital has been stylish ever since. A-lister fashion houses lace Via de' Tornabuoni and a Pandora's box of specialist boutiques selling all manner of beautiful objects parade alongside family-run botteghe (workshops) in a glorious tangle of medieval backstreets. Watch fourth-generation Florentine goldsmiths and shoemakers at work, buy artisan scents evocative of the Florentine countryside and Tuscan sea breeze, and know the tag 'Fiorentina' is one of the finest international labels going. Quality produce sourced locally, seasonally and sustainably is the holy trinity and Florentines share an enormous pride in their culinary tradition. Their city, surrounded by wine-rich hills, is a gourmet paradise where eating and drinking exceedingly well is mandatory. Be it a traditional bowl of earthy ribollita (bean, bread and veg soup), a tripe panino at a family-run food truck or a blue T-bone steak served in a market trattoria unchanged since 1915, dining in Florence is timeless and memorable. Raw cuisine, fish bistros, craft cocktails and the dazzling creativity of modern young Tuscan chefs add contemporary edge. Stand on a bridge over the Arno several times in a day and the light and mood changes every time. At sunset hike to Piazzale Michelangelo to be dazzled by a palette embracing every known shade of soft pink, orange and fiery amber. Surprisingly small as it is, Florence looms large on the world's 'must-sees' list – and not just for its unmatched treasure chest of art. Rich in culture, backdropped by history and anchored by family, faith and food, the Florentine lifestyle is enviably sweet.

43,edinburgh,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/edinburgh," Edinburgh is a city that begs to be discovered, filled with quirky, come-hither nooks that tempt you to explore just that little bit further. Edinburgh is one of Europe’s most beautiful cities, draped across a series of rocky hills overlooking the sea. It’s a town intimately entwined with its landscape, with buildings and monuments perched atop crags and overshadowed by cliffs. From the Old Town’s picturesque jumble of medieval tenements piled high along the Royal Mile, its turreted skyline strung between the black, bull-nosed Castle Rock and the russet palisade of Salisbury Crags, to the New Town’s neat grid of neoclassical respectability, the city offers a constantly changing perspective. The Athens of the North, an 18th-century Edinburgh nickname dreamed up by the great thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, is a city of high culture and lofty ideals, of art and literature, philosophy and science. It is here that each summer the world's biggest arts festival rises, phoenix-like, from the ashes of last year's rave reviews and broken box-office records to produce yet another string of superlatives. And it is here, beneath the Greek temples of Calton Hill – Edinburgh's acropolis – that the Scottish parliament sits again after a 300-year absence. Edinburgh is also known as Auld Reekie, a down-to-earth place that flicks an impudent finger at the pretensions of the literati. Auld Reekie is a city of loud, crowded pubs and decadent restaurants, late-night drinking and all-night parties, beer-fuelled poets and foul-mouthed comedians. It’s the city that tempted Robert Louis Stevenson from his law lectures to explore the drinking dens and lurid street life of the 19th-century Old Town. And it’s the city of Beltane, the resurrected pagan May Day festival, where half-naked revellers dance in the flickering firelight of bonfires beneath the stony indifference of Calton Hill's pillared monuments. Like a favourite book, Edinburgh is a city you’ll want to dip into again and again, savouring each time a different experience – the castle silhouetted against a blue spring sky with a yellow haze of daffodils misting the slopes below the esplanade; stumbling out of a late-night club into a summer dawn, with only the yawp of seagulls to break the unexpected silence; heading for a cafe on a chill December morning with the fog snagging the spires of the Old Town; and festival fireworks crackling in the night sky as you stand, transfixed, amid the crowds in Princes Street Gardens.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-529545421_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Kingdom,97.74,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,186525,"([(""Arthur's Seat"", ""Arthur's Seat is one of four hill forts, dating from around 2,000 years ago.

44,copenhagen,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/denmark/copenhagen," Copenhagen is the epitome of Scandi cool. Modernist lamps light New Nordic tables, bridges buzz with cycling commuters and eye-candy locals dive into pristine waterways. In little over a decade, Copenhagen has gone from dining dowager to culinary powerhouse. The Danish capital claims no less than 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, more than any other Scandinavian capital. In recent years, sous chefs from numerous high-profile kitchens have spread their own wings, opening a string of thrilling new eateries where culinary prowess comes with a more approachable price tag. Across the city, a wave of eateries are plating pure, organic produce from their own greenhouses, gardens and farms. Among them is the reincarnation of New Nordic maverick Noma. Come curious, come hungry. Only here does the morning rush of cyclists look more like a runway show on wheels. Forget Milan; when it comes to style, it's hard to beat Copenhagen's denizens. Few people have such a knack for effortless cool, driven by a reverence for simplicity, detail and understated beauty. These tenets drive everything from Copenhagen's painfully hip streetwear labels, its world-famous furniture and lighting, to its grassroots ceramics and glassware. Together they have created a city of endless visual pleasure; a place where even the most mundane activities are laced with a sense of quiet wonder and delight. When cities seek enlightenment, they commonly look to Copenhagen. The hometown of architect Jan Gehl – one of the world's leading authorities on sustainable urban planning – the Danish capital regularly tops world liveability lists. After all, this is one of the globe's greenest, cleanest, most sustainable urban centres, a place where cycling is serious transport, where buses and the metro run frequently and around the clock, and where the harbour is squeaky clean enough for a bracing dip. Leaving the sprawl to cities like Melbourne and LA, Copenhagen wisely keeps things compact and accessible, making it a super-easy place to explore. From Viking treasures in a former prince's palace to iconic Danish chairs in a one-time baroque hospital, Copenhagen's cultural offerings are rich and eclectic. Snoop around royal palaces crammed with blue-blood jewels and art, muse on the world's largest collection of Danish Golden Age paintings, or get up close and personal with the finest booty of ancient Egyptian sculpture in northern Europe. And did we mention Scandinavia's largest collection of Islamic art, tucked away in a collector's neoclassical mansion?

Enveloped in darkness, these damp and cold surroundings call ancient cathedrals and murky catacombs instantly to mind. History of The Cisterns The Cisterns, a long forgotten subterranean reservoir, once contained the supply of drinking water for the Danish capital and could hold as much as 16 million liters of clean water. Excavation began in 1856. Taking only three years to complete, the great structure quickly helped to alleviate many of the water supply problems of the day; but by 1933, the city’s cisterns ceased their function as a reservoir for drinking water, and they were finally drained in 1981. In 1996, in connection with Copenhagen’s status as European City of Culture – and through a joint initiative between the City of Frederiksberg and gallery owner Max Seidenfaden, who ran The Cisterns as a museum of modern glass art from 2001 to 2013– the underground water reservoir was put to use as an exhibition space. Today, The Cisterns is an integral part of Frederiksberg Museums, acting as a venue for art exhibitions and other events where the singularity of its architecture and atmosphere remains a core attraction. The Cisterns: A Cave within a CityLocated under Frederiksberg Hill in the heart of Søndermarken Park, The Cisterns is the only dripstone cave in Denmark.

46,krakow,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/malopolska/krakow," Poland's former royal capital effortlessly fuses medieval pomp and pageantry with modern-day, student-fuelled fun into a harmonious whole. Alternating themes of destruction and rebirth run throughout Kraków's history, all the way back to the 13th century, when marauding Tatars sacked the city and pierced the town crier's throat with an arrow. A century later, Kraków was back on top as Poland's capital, and then dashed again in the 16th century when the capital moved to Warsaw. In more recent times, Kraków re-emerged after WWI only to be occupied by Nazi Germany 20 years later. After that came communism, and another chapter of rebirth. It's a never-ending episode of Games of Thrones and just as enthralling. Architecture buffs will think they died and went to heaven. Over the thousand years of Kraków's existence, all of the great European architectural styles – Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque and art nouveau – have cycled through and left behind traces that prove the whole is infinitely greater than the sum of the parts. Find the world's largest late-Gothic altarpiece within the darkened interiors of St Mary's Basilica, and then step out into the sunshine to see the gleaming 16th-century Renaissance Cloth Hall, built at a time when Kraków's royal authority was at its apex. Kraków may no longer be Poland's political capital, but it makes a strong case for being the country's cultural capital. The annual list of festivals and events is as long as your arm, and every week, it seems, brings another celebration of theatre, the arts, music, film, dance, literature and, yes, food. Did we mention there's even a pierogi fest? Outside the festival calendar, Cracovians are inveterate theatregoers, jazz aficionados, poetry lovers, film buffs and klezmer listeners, and seemingly every corner of the city, every dark basement and hidden garden, buzzes with artistic anticipation. No accounting of Kraków's charms would be complete without a nod toward the culinary. Come for your fill of traditional delights like kiełbasa (Polish sausage), pierogi and vodka, served everywhere from grand Gothic cellars to simple stands. But Cracovians also love to expand their palates. French, Italian and Asian-inspired restaurants are popular, while vegan and vegetarian foods are experiencing something of a moment – vegan sushi and meatless kebabs are all the rage. Finish off with lody (ice cream), a national mania.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/102553187.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Poland,37,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,274772,"([(""Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square"", ""Huge 10-acre square, the largest in any of Europe's medieval cities, features the 16th-century Renaissance Cloth Hall and the splendid 14th-century Gothic Basilica of the Virgin Mary."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/b8/e5/33/wieza-ratuszowa-i-sukiennice.jpg'), ('Kazmierz The Former Jewish District', 'Sizable Jewish population of Krakow moved to this district at the end of the fifteenth century, which served as the main cultural center of the Polish Jewry for centuries.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/03/fc/35/97/jewish-district-kazimierz.jpg'), (""St Mary's Basilica"", ""One of the most famous of Poland's churches, this Gothic structure features two striking towers of different heights and surprisingly richly decorated insight, mostly thanks to the vibrant polychromy by great Polish artist Jan Matejko.

47,taipei,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/taiwan/taipei," Taipei is a friendly city whose allure lies in its blend of Chinese culture with a curious fusion of Japanese, Southeast Asian and American influences. In many ways this 300-year-old city is like a living museum. The Taoist temples buzz with the prayers of the hopeful; the wooden boards of Japanese-era mansions creak under the feet of visitors; while the treasures in the National Palace Museum date back 5000 years. Merchant villas to military barracks have been restored, reworked and now live again as a museum or a shopfront. From the heirlooms of a tea merchant to the memories of a cemetery for the victims of the White Terror, Taipei is a city that takes great pride in celebrating its history – the triumphant and the tragic. Taipei's oddness is one of its charms. It may be inspired by the kawaii (cutesy) culture of Japan, but there's a lot of home-grown humour in there, too. In the puppet museum you will find a strip-tease marionette; the idea of chocolate sauce on a steak is nothing out of the ordinary; themed restaurants transport you to a world where hotpot is slurped from a toilet bowl; a park installation invites you to cycle a stationary bike whose pedals power an eerie-sounding pipe organ; and one of the top souvenir items from the city is a larger-than-life cock-shaped pineapple sponge cake. Dining out is so popular that many studio apartments in Taipei don't have kitchens: eating out is cheap, casual and tasty and many families do that or get takeaway most nights of the week. Indeed dining out is the best way to understand the Taiwanese. Whether you're getting your fingers greasy sampling snacks at one of the night markets or sharing dishes at a Taiwanese rèchǎo (stir-fried) joint, the defining characteristic is the element of fun. Yes, that is an invitation to try stinky tofu. While you're at it, you might as well have some Taiwan Beer, too! With its lanes of blackened walk-ups and countless shopfronts, the city may look like it was thrown together in a hurry, but look again. Great care has been taken to make it a truly liveable place for people: public transport grids the city well and is fast, reliable and cheap; every few blocks there's a park with a generous supply of benches, shelters and flowers; good (and often great) coffee is available everywhere; the MRT has courtesy umbrellas free for rainy days; and a clean and free public toilet is never far away.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/f15f7b57ab31c217f471c6712a2654e0-taipei-101.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Taiwan,28,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,293913,"([('Fulong International Sand Sculpture Festival', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/65/2a/63/japan.jpg'), ('Miniatures Museum of Taiwan', 'The Miniatures Museum contains first-rate artwork produced by renowned artists from around the world.

48,kyoto,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/kansai/kyoto," Kyoto is old Japan writ large: atmospheric temples, sublime gardens, traditional teahouses and geisha scurrying to secret liaisons. This is a city of some 2000 temples and shrines: a city of true masterpieces of religious architecture, such as the retina-burning splendour of Kinkaku-ji (the famed Golden Pavilion) and the cavernous expanse of Higashi Hongan-ji. It's where robed monks shuffle between temple buildings, prayer chants resonate through stunning Zen gardens, and the faithful meditate on tatami-mat floors. Even as the modern city buzzes and shifts all around, a waft of burning incense, or the sight of a bright vermillion torii gate marking a shrine entrance, are regular reminders that Kyoto remains the spiritual heart of Japan. Few cities of this size pack such a punch when it comes to their culinary cred, and at its heart is Nishiki Market ('Kyoto's kitchen'). Kyoto is crammed with everything from Michelin-starred restaurants, chic cocktail bars, cool cafes and sushi spots to food halls, izakaya (Japanese pub-eateries), craft-beer bars and old-school noodle joints. Splurge on the impossibly refined cuisine known as kaiseki while gazing over your private garden, taste the most delicate tempura in a traditional building, slurp down steaming bowls of ramen elbow-to-elbow with locals, then slip into a sugar coma from a towering matcha (powdered green tea) sundae. While the rest of Japan has adopted modernity with abandon, the old ways are still clinging on in Kyoto. With its roots as the cultural capital of the country, it's no surprise that many traditional arts and crafts are kept alive by artisans from generation to generation. Wander the streets downtown, through historic Gion and past machiya (traditional Japanese townhouses) in the Nishijin textile district to find ancient speciality shops from tofu sellers, washi (Japanese handmade paper) and tea merchants, to exquisite lacquerware, handcrafted copper chazutsu (tea canisters) and indigo-dyed noren (hanging curtains). If you don't know your matcha (powdered green tea) from your manga (Japanese comic), have never slept on a futon or had a bath with naked strangers, then it doesn't matter as this is the place to immerse yourself in the intricacies of Japanese culture. Whether you watch matcha being whisked in a traditional tea ceremony, spend the night in a ryokan, get your gear off and soak in an onsen, join a raucous hanami (cherry-blossom viewing) party or discover the art of Japanese cooking – you'll come away one step closer to understanding the unique Japanese way of life.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/96681879.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Japan,28,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,298564,"([('Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine', 'This shrine is one of many located throughout Japan that was built to honor Inari, the Shinto god of rice.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/12/10/f5/a1/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Hieizan Enryaku-ji Temple', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0f/19/6e/d6/caption.jpg'), ('Byodoin Temple', 'Temple near Kyoto; famous statue of seated Buudha by 11th-century sculptor, Jocho.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/3e/01/72/phoenix-hall.jpg'), ('Kinkakuji Temple', ""One of Kyoto's most famous attractions, this temple was originally built in 1397 as a residence for shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.

49,brussels,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/brussels," Historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, self-confident yet unshowy, Brussels is multicultural to its roots. The cityscape swings from majestic to quirky to rundown and back again. Art deco facades face off against 1960s concrete developments, and regal 19th-century mansions contrast with the shimmering glass of the EU’s Gotham City. This whole maelstrom swirls out from Brussels’ medieval core, where the Grand Place is surely one of the world’s most beautiful squares. But Brussels' greatest architectural expression came at the turn of the 19th century with art nouveau, and its master builder is Horta. While restraint characterises his exteriors, the interiors are sensual symphonies of form and colour. Sometimes it seems as if every building in the city is being converted into a contemporary art gallery, from townhouses to skating rinks to the vast canal-side Citroën garage being remodelled to showcase conceptual art. With property prices lower than Paris, many commercial galleries are choosing to shift to the city. And students and young artists are opening their doors to show work at open studio weekends and event nights. Whether you prefer iconoclastic or outsider art, Magritte or the Flemish Primitives, there really is something for every art lover in Brussels. As with many other aspects of life, the people of Brussels like to eat and drink a little differently, and there are some deeply ingrained habits: delicious frites have to be double fried, and the classic waffle comes with a snowfall of icing sugar. They even have their own biscuit: the shortcrust cinnamon speculoos. In addition to the fabled beer, which many visitors focus their trip around, Brussels boasts the half-en-half, a heady mix of white wine and champagne. In recent times there has been an increasing focus on local organic cuisine, and this heavy eating city is definitely getting healthier. Brussels’ once resolutely working-class Marolles quarter has partly shed its proletarian image with a clutch of intimate restaurants and funky interior-design shops along the main streets, Rue Haute and Rue Blaes. Nonetheless, pockets of original Bruxellois character can still be found, notably around the Place du Jeu-de-Balle. At a few of the enjoyable downmarket cafés here you might overhear people speaking in the earthy Bruxellois dialect, and at least one stall still sells the traditional street food: snails. Note that, despite the name, Jeu-de-Balle (aka balle-pelotte) is no longer played here.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/99226269.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Belgium,60,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,188644,"([('Grand Place', 'Considered one of the most beautiful medieval squares in Europe, the ornate Grand Place is the center of Brussels, where many historic buildings dating from the 17th century are located.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/37/83/7c/grand-place.jpg'), (""Musee des Beaux-Arts d'Ixelles"", '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/8a/a6/e6/brussels-musee-des-beaux.jpg'), ('Musee Constantin Meunier', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/f7/36/26/l-atelier-de-constantin.jpg'), ('Happy Day', ""Want to have a good time in the presence of multiple paintings.

51,porto,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/the-north/porto," Opening up like a pop-up book from the banks of the Rio Douro, edgy-yet-opulent Porto entices with its historic centre, sumptuous food and wine, and charismatic locals. Porto’s charms are as subtle as the nuances of an aged tawny port, best savoured slowly on a romp through the hilly backstreets of Miragaia, Ribeira and Massarelos. It’s the quiet moments of reflection and the snapshots of daily life that you’ll remember most: the slosh of the Douro against the docks; the snap of laundry drying in river winds; the sound of port glasses clinking; the sight of young lovers discreetly tangled under a landmark bridge, on the rim of a park fountain, in the crumbling notch of a graffiti-blasted wall… Beyond Porto’s alley-woven historic heart, contemporary architects have left their idiosyncratic stamp on the city’s skyline. Winging Porto into the 21st century is Álvaro Siza Vieira’s crisply minimalist Museu de Arte Contemporânea and Rem Koolhaas’ daringly iconic Casa da Música. Public art is everywhere, from azulejos (hand-painted tiles) glamming up the metro to street art tattooed across crumbling medieval walls. Costah and Hazul, who always work incognito, have blazed their patterns along the streets of the Aliados, Miragaia and Massarelos. With much-lauded chefs like Pedro Lemos, Ricardo Costa, Rui Paula and José Avillez shaking the pans, the city's culinary star continues to rise. Take Vasco Coelho Santos at the new Euskalduna Studio, for instance, wowing with highly experimental 10-course menus, Vítor Matos at Michelin-starred Antiqvvm, or José Cordeiro at The Blini, an upscale marisquería putting stunning riffs on Atlantic-fresh seafood in Gaia. Petiscarias (Portuguese-style tapas bars), gourmet steakhouses, brunch cafes, hallowed port cellars, craft beer bars, food markets – you name it, Porto nails it. Bom apetite! Porto holds you captive at its sky-high miradouros (lookouts) and on-trend roof terrace bars. From the Sé cathedral terrace and Gaia’s hilltop Jardim do Morro, the city is reduced to postcard format: a colourful tumbledown dream with soaring bell towers, extravagant baroque churches and stately beaux arts buildings. Equally ravishing is Jardins do Palácio de Cristal’s palm-fringed, fountain-speckled gardens. Even in the city's heart, seagulls soar on Atlantic breezes, and a rickety ride on tram 1 trundles to the wide open ocean in Foz do Douro in minutes.

53,brisbane-1336826,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/queensland/brisbane-1336826," No longer satisfied in the shadow of Sydney and Melbourne, Brisbane is subverting stereotypes and surprising the critics. Welcome to Australia's new subtropical 'It kid'. Brisbane has a climate its more famous southern rivals would kill for (despite what they may tell you). When Sydney and Melbourne shiver through the winter months, Brisbane continues basking in the sun. After all, this is the capital city of the Sunshine State, a meteorological Promised Land where winters are mild and short enough for a daytime alfresco toast. It's a fact not lost on Brisbanites, who indulge in outdoor thrills all year round, from inner-city rock-climbing and kayaking, to riverside cycling and sunning on the nation's only man-made city beach. The Brisbane food scene is booming. Innovation and ingenuity are the key words these days, driving everything from Gauge's cult-status black garlic bread to Nodo's Valrhona chocolate and beetroot dougnuts. Menus across the city are flaunting the seasonal and the regional, transforming top-notch produce into beautiful, confident dishes spanning all budgets and countless cuisines. Imbibing in Brisbane is no less impressive, with a sharp, competent booty of specialty coffee microroasteries, microbreweries and cocktail bars pouring faultless single-origin brews, seasonal beers and out-of-the-box cocktails crafted with everything from lemon myrtle to local Brisbane honey. Forget the 'cultural backwater' tag. Brisbane 2.0 is a kicking hub of creativity, with an expanding arsenal of enlightening, thought-provoking drawcards. It's here that you'll find the Australia's largest public gallery of modern art (GOMA) and its most important festival of new Australian music (Bigsound Festival). Whether you're up for catching a cult-status band in a state-of-the-art hangar, a subversive cabaret in a one-time power station, or an opera in a subterranean reservoir, this town has you covered.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/8608644.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Australia,97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,255068,"([('Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary', ""Discover over 70 species of Australian native animals in a beautiful, natural bush setting at the world's first and largest koala sanctuary.

54,toronto,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/toronto," Bright and bustling, Toronto is a cosmopolitan city whose residents have roots across the globe. Art, food, beaches, nightlife – in Toronto, you’ve got it all. Where to begin? Toronto is itself a cultural phenomenon, with residents from around the world and scores of languages, foods, customs and celebrations – they’re what make the city great. As Canada’s largest city, Toronto has outstanding museums and galleries, from the Frank Gehry–redesigned Art Gallery of Ontario to the delightful Bata Shoe Museum (yes, shoes). The same goes for theatres; the gorgeous Elgin & Winter Garden Theatre has backstage tours as well as regular shows, and Shakespeare in High Park channels the Bard every summer. There’s live music, poetry readings, comedy shows, LGBTIQ+ spots and more, too. People gotta eat, and nowhere is Toronto’s remarkable diversity more evident than in its food and restaurants. Pakistani, Persian, Portuguese; aboriginal and new fusion; Japanese pancakes and Korean barbecue; fresh pasta in Little Italy, shawarmas in Greektown and the best damn dumplings in Chinatown. Torontonians love to eat out, whether it's sitting at sidewalk bistros on a warm summer night or getting all bundled up for some hot Vietnamese pho. That's to say nothing of Toronto’s great food on the go – there are peameal-bacon sandwiches at St Lawrence Market and food trucks selling an array of fragrant delights. No matter what your taste in drinks and nightlife, Toronto has you covered. It's no surprise that this humming metropolis has sleek martini bars and high-end cocktail lounges – some of the best are on rooftops. But it’s also an old city, with ancient pubs and gritty dive bars – just the sort of place adventurous travelers love. And of course there are craft breweries where bearded bartenders serve handcrafted suds in curated flights. Add to all this nightclubs, drag shows, poetry slams, comedy clubs and more, and it’s easy to have a great night out in Toronto. Like any place that's cold, Toronto adores its spring and summer months. Torontonians aren’t necessarily outdoorsy as a bunch, but the city makes it easy to enjoy those precious sunny days. There are beaches and waterfront paths along Lake Ontario, plus kayaking or standup paddling around the Toronto Islands. Green spaces such as High Park and Kew Gardens, huge and grassy, are perfect for a picnic and an afternoon stroll, while the east end has a growing network of leafy bike paths and walkways. Even in winter, on a gray, chilly day, there’s outdoor ice skating to enjoy!",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-548748501_full.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Canada,86.21,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,155019,"([(""Ripley's Aquarium of Canada"", ""Explore the Waters of the World at Ripley's Aquarium of Canada.

60,abu-dhabi,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/united-arab-emirates/abu-dhabi," Proudly modern and cosmopolitan, Abu Dhabi is the UAE's forward-thinking cultural heart where nothing stands still – except perhaps the herons in its mangroves. The Louvre Abu Dhabi, with its globe-trotting collection covering the breadth of humanity's artistic achievements, finally threw open its doors in 2017. It's the first of the city's planned mega-museum projects to open and a major feather in Abu Dhabi's cap as it pushes to become the region's cultural leader. This world-class museum may get all the buzz but more locally focused sights get a look-in too. Emirati heritage can be difficult to seek out but pearl journey dhow trips and the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital take you behind the curtain to get a glimpse of it. Opulent, dramatic and no expense spared: the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is a triumph of Islamic architecture for the modern world. Architectural nods to all the great Islamic empires of past from Fatimid Egypt to South Asia's Mughal dynasty are represented among its blinding white marble facade, but this is a mosque thoroughly of and for the 21st century, with striking contemporary artistry at its heart. Non-Muslims may only be allowed to enter a single mosque in the city, but the one they can, is magnificent. Need some adrenaline in your life? Yas Island provides enough distractions to keep even the most dedicated thrill-seeker happy. This is the setting for the famed Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the track hallowed ground for Formula One fans.

Off the track, Ferrari World and its speed-freak favourite Formula Rossa roller coaster plus Warner Bros World provide full-on family entertainment with enough rides to wear out and sate the thrill tick-list of kids and adults alike. There's no need to leave the city for a beach-break, Abu Dhabi offers a swath of sand for everyone. Saadiyat Island has one of the nicest slices of public beach (with a minimal fee) while Al Bateen, the Corniche and the brand-spanking-new beach on Hudayriat Island offer up completely free swags of sandy fun.

63,jerusalem,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/israel-and-the-palestinian-territories/jerusalem," Destroyed and rebuilt over thousands of years, Jerusalem's spiritual magnetism endures. With interlacing histories, clashing cultures and constant reinvention, the city is an intense, multisensory experience. Jerusalem's Old City is a spiritual lightning rod, sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians. Wide-eyed with awe, pilgrims flood into the walled city to worship at locations linked to the very foundation of their faith. Church bells, Islamic calls to prayer and the shofar (Jewish ram's horn) electrify the air with a beguiling, if not harmonious, melody, and fragrances of incense, coffee and candle smoke drift through the thrumming souqs (markets). Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Armenian quarters each add their own spice, but this diversity grew from millennia of bloody sieges and transfers of power, leaving still visible deep wounds. Thousands of years of political, territorial, ethnic and religious conflict have scarred Jerusalem. One result of this historic, and ongoing, turbulence is Jerusalem's demographic smorgasbord of immigrants from around the world. Dozens of nationalities are represented, each adding their own spirituality, culture and cuisine to Jerusalem's rich mix, while secular and religious battle lines continue to be drawn and redrawn. The uncertain status of East Jerusalem creates the most painful divisions. Though clashes (sometimes violent) continue, many Palestinians still hope for a future in which East Jerusalem is the capital of a Palestinian state. Even as Jerusalem hurtles towards the future, the past informs its present. Downtown's modern buildings are encased in rosy Jerusalem stone, the same colour palette as the Old City. Experimental performing arts centres are housed in 19th-century buildings. Ever-growing ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods can be found moments away from million-dollar condominiums, while old-school fruit and vegetable sellers sit next to craft beer and coffee stalls in Mahane Yehuda Market. Meanwhile in East Jerusalem, the future is debated in bookshops, cafes and confronting art galleries. Layers of history continue to be unearthed in Jerusalem, a city where ancient worlds are tantalisingly close. Guides lead groups beneath the Western Wall, and candlelit church crypts hold treasured shrines. At the City of David, visitors are ushered through watery passageways and past active dig sites. Hardly a month goes by without a significant discovery being made in and around the Old City. Unsurprisingly, the city's archaeological sites are highly contentious, in particular the bitterly controversial expansion of the City of David site into Palestinian communities. In Jerusalem, history isn't a closed chapter.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/15970771.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Israel,84.97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,293983,"([('Yad Vashem -  The World Holocaust Remembrance Center', 'The World Holocaust Remembrance Center is a 45-acre campus comprised of indoor museums, outdoor monuments, gardens and sculptures.

64,naples,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/campania/naples," Naples is raw, high-octane energy, a place of soul-stirring art and panoramas, spontaneous conversations and unexpected, inimitable elegance. Welcome to Italy's most unlikely masterpiece. Naples' wealth of cultural assets is extraordinary. You'll find two royal palaces, three castles, and ancient ruins that include some of Christianity's oldest frescoes. The city's Museo Archeologico Nazionale claims the world's finest collection of Pompeiian frescoes and mosaics, while its Cappella Sansevero holds Italy's most extraordinary marble sculpture. You'll find Caravaggio masterpieces in the Pio Monte della Misericordia, Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano and Museo di Capodimonte, the latter palace home to countless masterpieces. Of course, we could also mention all those frescoed baroque cupolas, but that would just be boasting. Naples' millennia-old backstory could bust a bookshelf. Settled by the Greeks and conquered by the Romans, it's a nail-biting tale where myth and fact entwine into one bewitching whole. Did Queen Joan II really throw her lovers to a peckish crocodile in the Castel Nuovo? Do the skulls inside the Cimitero delle Fontanelle have esoteric powers? And just how did alchemist prince Raimondo di Sangro create those inexplicably perfect arterial systems inside his Cappella Sansevero? Curious tales and unsolved mysteries seep out of every Neapolitan stone, casting a strange, hypnotic spell. Blessed with rich volcanic soils, a bountiful sea, and countless generations of culinary know-how, the Naples region is one of Italy's epicurean heavyweights. It's here that you'll find the country's best pizza, pasta and espresso, its most appetising street markets, not to mention some of its most celebrated dishes. From garlicky spaghetti alle vongole (spaghetti with clams) to sultry ragù (meat and tomato sauce) and silky parmigiana di melanzane (eggplant parmigiana), the food on these streets is all about intensity and pleasure. After all, life is too short for diets, so follow the locals' lead and succumb to your gluttonous whims. In Naples, retail therapy is as individualistic as the city itself. Here, global chains still play second fiddle to family-run businesses and artisan workshops. Neapolitan tailors have long lured foreign dandies with their impeccable suits, shirts and ties, while the city's handmade leather gloves are sought by the global fashion royalty. Skinny streets and weathered courtyards are dotted with a plethora of workshops and boutiques, selling everything from butter-soft satchels, organic ceramics and meticulous pastori (nativity-scene figurines), to rare Neapolitan lithographs and gourmet local food and wine.

It is not clear the specific date but archaeological studies show the late sixth - early fifth century BC. Initially were only inhabitants coming from the city of Cuma, then others settlers were also added: Calcidesi, Pithecusan, (today\'s citizens from Ischia) and the Athenians. The urban layout of Neapolis is structured in a regular network of streets. History and archeology, architecture, sculpture and painting of San Lorenzo Maggiore Complex had already written important chapters in the history of Naples. It can be assumed that St. Lawrence complex - geographically and topographically- is the heart of Old Naples The deepest backgrounds of the complex of San Lorenzo can be found in the basement of the Greek - Roman Neapolis, at the ""Via Augustale"", where, in the Roman period were stationed the general markets. At the end of the fifth century AD, a huge flood, a mixture of mud, stones and water buried the whole area. Later it was built an Early Christian Basilica dedicated to St. Lawrence Martyr. John Bishop of Aversa donated the early Christian basilica of S. Lorenzo to the Friars Minor, in 1234. The primary Basilica was later replaced by the current monument, which construction began in 1284 under King Charles I of Anjou. The Friars Minor have devised the new complex of S. Lorenzo, supported and protected by the Anjou King, who provided a constant devotion to the brothers of St. Francis of Assisi, favoring them with generous donations and lands. A particular event explains the deep pledge between the Angevin sovereigns to the Friars Minor: a son of Charles II of Anjou, Ludovico, attracted by Franciscan Friaries way, joined the Order of Friars Minor. Ludovico was elected bishop of Toulouse Immediately after his religious profession. He had lived poor and died very young, in 1297; he was canonized in 1317 by Pope John XXII. The Archeological Area The model that we cross just entered the cloister, makes us understand how was settled the Roman market. Neapolis had three main streets: the upper decumanus currently via Anticaglie; the Major decumanus currently Via Tribunali and the lower decumanus, currently Via San Biaggio dei Librai or better known as Spaccanapoli. The underground archaeological area of San Lorenzo Maggiore extends below the transept of the Angevin church, the chapter house and the southern arm and the west of the monastery. The monument in tuff blocks of IV-III century. B.C. was replaced by a building market to the imperial age. It is arranged on two floors exploiting the existing natural gap between the portion of the street stalls and the Courts of stenopos in alignment with Vico Giganti, visible in the archaeological underground area. The complex as a whole seems to be the result of a unified building program, but it is currently not possible to determine what date from the initial phase of this impressive monumental structure is. The most recognizable part of the romans buildings is date based by the technical construction in the late first - early second century. A.D., after the earthquakes of 62 and 64 A.D. and the eruption of 79 A.D. Only a few clues remain of the late Republican and Augustan period, despite the Emperor Augustus and his descendants has been attributed many edifice projects in the city. The construction previous mentioned was composed of two floors. The first floor was occupied by ""macellum"", a market intended for sale of foodstuffs, consisting of a rectangular space porch with circular pavilion of the tholos at the center. It invokes a common type of Hellenistic period, attested to the imperial age in Campania at Pompeii and Pozzuoli in the Serapeum. The tholos was part of an enclosure with a mosaic of large white tiles, which opened a porch covered with marble slabs. The tholos was a small temple. It was the place where merchants were offering the first fruits to God hoping to get back multiply profits. The basement of the circular building is preserved, three steps with a few tracks with marble facing and part of a terracotta funnel. It is now partially visible an oval slot realized on the occasion of the re-paving of the cloister. The main entrance was on Via Tribunali, while the stairs connect the lower level of the monument, to the portion of stenapos in the underground archaeological area.The eastern front of the complex includes a small building in the North organized into two narrow shafts interconnected with brick facade punctuated by a pediment with two pilasters, in which a door opens and a tiny window of a thick railing. Toward to the south nine tabernae bipartite in two adjoining spaces, with a vaulted ceiling: the facade is made of brickwork, instead the perimeter walls and partitions of rooms were in reticulate. In such environments can be observed, reflecting the commercial use of the area, elements such as an oven and tanks, which, often documenting phases of use of a later period the original structure. a. The first tavern is ""Erarium"" today would be called the bank. Probably romans preserved the treasure of the city! The place is particularly interesting for the signs from the big iron bars. b. Tabernae fulloniche today would be called dyeing. You can admire tubs and sinks where were brought cloths, washed and dyed with natural detergents soda, clay, purple and uric acid. c. Bakery. Someone jokingly calls ""the grandmother’s pizzerias” It is interesting to note the shape of the dome of the oven and the cooker top. To the south of the modular system, tabernae bind to a cryptoporticus, a long basement corridor reticulate and brick arches with barrel vaults, divided into smaller adjoining rooms. The building rests, using as the back wall, on the screen in yellow tuff blocks of the fourth century BC phase. In the cryptoporticus can be admired the stone counters, of uncertain interpretation, however, given the presence of small flow channels of water perhaps were used to expose and sell fish. Entering in a new environment where you notice a water collector, perhaps of Greek origin: it is important to note the arrangement of stones, placed in barrels, round shape with a particular shape and without the mortar between the stones. All block interlocked. The age we talk about 150-200 BC The following environments were more elegant edifices, that were built with better materials as can be seen from the mosaic floors and “impluvium”, a gush of water inputs of Roman."" These rooms were a particularly popular venue for meetings of philosophers and political scientists called ""scole"". In the last area after the corridor, on the right wall, you can see a few remains of frescoes and mosaic floor in particular. Chapter Hall In the middle of the east side of the cloister is the entrance to the Chapter Hall, decorated with a Gothic portal of the second quarter of the fourteenth century, flanked by beautiful windows with four lights and surmounted by a low arch bezel. Above these beautiful quadrifore it was found parts of a fresco (and recently restored), probably painted by a strict observance unknown artist disciple of Giotto around 1340, depicting St. Francis, who gives the rule to friaries and the Poor Clares of Assisi. The fresco was detached years ago and kept inside of the Museum; it is curious to observe how this fourteenth-century fresco was the model of the table of Colantonio with the same subject, part of the altarpiece for the Sanchez family, one time was kept in San Lorenzo but now is on the Museum of Capodimonte. The Chapter Hall is 7.50 meters high, wide 16.30 meters and deep 12.8 meters. It preserves the Gothic structure, with six vaults supported by two ancient granite bare columns; in what reminds the Chapter House of St. Augustine at the Mint in Naples, built slightly earlier. There are frescoes with grotesque decorations, allegorical figures of Sand and Villa, with a small central fresco depicting the Virgin Mary and under the 1608 date; in the surrounding walls there are paintings in the shape of trees with fruits representatives of people (men and women) of great cultural value, theological, scientists, kings and queens, followers of St. Francis of Assisi. Its author was almost certainly Luigi Rodriguez. The Sisto V Hall The Sixtus V Hall consists of a great rectangular hall, 43.60 meters long and wide 9.80 meters. The main entrance is an elegant antique vestibule Swabian which, according to Celano, was once frescoed. This majestic hall was for a long time the place of the Neapolitan Parliament meeting. The frescoes on the walls and on the vaults date back to the early 17 century were executed by Luigi Rodriguez, during the reign of Philip III, commissioned by the Viceroy Ferdinando Ruiz Castro and Andrada. The vault is divided into seven compartments, each of which are painted life-size seven Virtues; more precisely, at the center of each compartment it is depicted one of the seven main virtues (Clemenza, Providence, Gravity, Magnificence, Dignity Director, magnanimity, affability), surrounded by four smaller Virtue for each main one. In the semicircles of lateral arch can be seen views of Naples that correspond to the different provinces of the Kingdom: today you can admire them only six. Finally, the decoration of the room is completed with coats of arms, arabesques and allegories. Only the lower part of the perimeter walls, for a height of 4 meters from the floor, it was not covered with frescoes: it was the custom to cover these portions of walls with tapestries and precious fabrics to increase the local magnificence.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/fd/d5/ec/sala-capitolare.jpg'), ('Isola di Procida', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0a/05/ff/28/isola-di-procida.jpg'), ('MUSA - Museo Universitario delle Scienze e delle Arti', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/42/29/ee/ta-img-20190128-131010.jpg'), ('Via dei Tribunali', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/31/15/9c/via-dei-tribunali.jpg'), ('Napulitanata', 'Napulitanata is a concert hall dedicated to Neapolitan Music Heritage, especially to Canzone Napoletana and Tarantella.

65,hobart,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/tasmania/hobart," No doubt about it, Hobart’s future is looking rosy. Tourism is booming and the old town is humming with low vacancy rates, high real-estate prices and new-found self-confidence. Hobart is a harbour town – a port city where the world rushes in on the tide and ebbs away again, bringing with it influences from afar and leaving the locals buzzing with a global zeitgeist. Or so the theory goes. These days Hobart’s waterfront precinct is certainly abuzz, with old pubs alongside new craft-beer bars, myriad cafes, museums, festivals, ferries, fishing boats, yachts, accommodation and a floating pier upholding fine restaurants…all of it washed with sea-salty charm and a sense of history. On a sunny afternoon, there are few more pleasant places to find yourself. Riding high above the city is kunanyi/Mt Wellington, a craggy basalt beast seemingly made for mountain biking and bushwalking. Known as kunanyi by local Aboriginal people, and just 'the mountain' by everybody else, this 1271m-high monolith both defines the city below and shelters it. Drive to the summit in any season – you're assured of either a show-stopping view or an out-of-time, lunar, cloud-shrouded experience, wandering around between snowdrifts, lichen-dappled boulders and the stunted plants that somehow survive in these lofty skies. Finally, barrel back down to the waterfront on a mountain-bike tour like no other. Watery cappuccino? Lukewarm sausage roll? Maybe a deep-fried, reconstituted squid ring? Forget it: the bad old days of Hobart food and drink are long gone. The new order of service here focuses on top-quality local and seasonal produce, turned by deft chefs into marvellous restaurant, cafe and pub meals. Coffee culture is also firmly entrenched, with double-shot pick-me-ups available at every turn. And booze? Cascade Brewery leads Australian's mainstream brewing brigade, but an under-fleet of creative craft-beer breweries is also bubbling up here. And with dinner, cool-climate wines from the nearby Coal and Derwent river valleys are hard to beat. Hobart's summer festival season is an absolute blast! For a few weeks circling around New Year's Eve, this little city goes berserk with travellers, foodies, musicians, and sailors from the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race turning the town upside down. The Taste of Tasmanian festival, highlighting local produce, is the summer centrepiece. Then, in the depths of winter, Hobart's more macabre, unhinged side comes out to play: the Dark MOFO festival shines a pale gothic light on the city's past and present, with visitors revelling in offbeat performances, feasts, bonfires, installations and plenty of good red wine.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/iStock_000056436568XLarge.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Australia,97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,255097,"([('Mount Wellington', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/48/11/2f/the-pinnacle-mt-wellington.jpg'), ('Cascade Brewery', ""Step inside Australia's oldest operating brewery, nestled at the foot of the majestic Mount Wellington, to learn how Cascade has been crafting beer since 1832.

68,nashville,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/nashville," Nashville is on a roll that just won't stop. Country-music stars are slapping their names on brand-new honky-tonks. Boutique hotels seem to open monthly. Bachelors and bachelorettes are arriving in hordes to party. And acclaimed chefs are going far beyond the meat-and-three, though biscuits and hot chicken are doing just fine. Honky-tonks, boutique hotels and chef-driven restaurants are opening at a head-snapping pace, welcoming bachelors and bachelorette parties galore and a gobsmacking stream of brand-new residents. The Country Music Hall of Fame in downtown Nashville traces the history of country music, whereas museums dedicated to Johnny Cash, George Jones and Willie Nelson delve into their personal stories. Weekly country-music show the Grand Ole Opry, first broadcast on a Nashville radio station, will celebrate its 95th birthday in 2020. The music scene today is as vibrant as ever: seven days a week the neon lights and beer-perfumed air of Lower Broadway draw crowds of grinning music-lovers into its rumbling honky-tonks, while just to the south the vast, undulating roof of Music City Center imprints a giant guitar shape onto the skyline. The Grand Ole Opry wows guests at Opryland and Ryman Auditorium, and hordes of country-music fans descend on the city for the CMA Music Festival. Several country stars have recently opened their own clubs on Broadway. Another reason Nashville's hot: a half-dozen flourishing neighborhoods packed tight with unique shops, indie coffeehouses, innovative bakeries, new breweries and distilleries, and a surprising number of bright murals ready to provide a backdrop for your selfie. East Nashville is home to the city's artisan scene, while 12th Ave S brings the shoppers with its stylish boutiques, vintage collections and gift shops. A sophisticated array of restaurants fills the Gulch, and people-watchers pack out patios in Hillsboro Village. Each neighborhood has a distinct personality, but they're linked by a common commitment to Southern hospitality. If you need a break from bachelorette-party shenanigans or a boring convention panel, step outside for natural distractions aplenty. An ever-growing network of pedestrian and bike-friendly greenways links Nashville's city parks, which unfurl over rolling hills and lush riparian landscapes. B-Cycle bike-rental stations are conveniently placed at greenway trailheads. Nature and outdoor centers inside the larger parks offer kid-friendly activities and nature walks.

In August 1982, months before opening, a staff of 10 began landscaping the Garden Conservatory, which was at that time one of the largest facilities of its kind in a single, glass-topped room in the world. Many of the taller plants were put in place before construction was completed, in advance of installing the thousands of flowers that add color and texture to the majestic space. It took staff 3 months to install the gardens of the Garden Conservatory Atrium. A precise drip-irrigation system was developed that allows many plants to be watered slowly over the course of several hours. The soil is a special mixture of pine, peat and cypress bark solelite developed specifically for the environment. For the Cascades Atrium, dozens of Florida nurseries were visited before staff selected more than 8200 tropical ornamental plants representing 449 species. Plant varieties range from an Alexandria palm tree towering more than 40 feet high to six-foot-tall ginger bushes and jasminum vines. Sunlight levels are higher in the Cascades than in the Garden Conservatory, providing a sustainable environment for different plant varieties. Beyond the Cascades is the Delta Atrium, an amazing indoor garden with a subtropical feeling. Even though it is an indoor environment, 370 trees and palms--between 20- and 40-feet tall--share space with thousands of smaller plants. To create the appearance of the outdoors, black olive trees and West Indian mahoganies were chosen for their resemblance to oaks. Unlike oaks, they do not shed their leaves. And in true Southern tradition, Spanish moss trails from their imposing branches. Design of the Delta's gardens began two years before the Delta's opening in June 1996. Most of the plants originated in Florida. It took 32 tractor trailers to transport them to their new home in the protected environment of the Delta Atrium. The Delta is a true garden of the South with 120 sabal palms, tall lady palms, camellias, banana trees and cycads. Primary hedging plants are ever-blooming gardenia and camellias pittosporum (both green and variegated). There are 1500 plants representing 30 varieties of camellias in the Delta. Two 40-foot-tall Magnolia grandiflora (Southern magnolias) accent the front of the Delta Mansion.

69,helsinki,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/finland/helsinki," Entwined with the Baltic's bays, inlets and islands, Helsinki's boulevards and backstreets overflow with magnificent architecture, intriguing drinking and dining venues and groundbreaking design. Finland is famed for its streamlined, functional, stylish design. In the 20th century, pioneers such as Alvar and Aino Aalto cemented its reputation, and the capital remains the country's creative hub. Helsinki's design scene is one of the most electrifying in the world today, and a major influence across the globe. Boutiques, workshops and galleries filled with glassware, lighting, textiles and innovative homewares proliferate in the Design District just south of the centre in Punavuori, which is home to Helsinki's superb Design Museum, and throughout the city, from its thoroughfares to repurposed industrial spaces. Taking its cues from the design scene, architecture in Helsinki is flourishing. Contemporary highlights include the Kiasma museum of contemporary art (1998) and concert hall Musiikkitalo (2011). Modernism is exemplified by Alvar Aalto's Akateeminen Kirjakauppa (1969) and Finlandia Talo concert hall (1971), along with Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen's astonishing rock-carved church, the Temppeliaukio (1969). Finland's art-nouveau movement, National Romanticism, has left a glorious legacy of buildings from the era such as Helsinki's beautiful train station (1919). Functionalism, wooden architecture (including 1920s classicism and 2012's Kamppi chapel) and Byzantine-Russian, neo-Renaissance and neoclassical styles are all woven into the city's fabric. Locally sourced, seasonal, sustainably farmed and foraged ingredients might be red-hot worldwide trends today, but in Finland they have long been a way of life. Wildlife such as reindeer, elk, bear and snow grouse, along with shoals of fish such as salmon and freshwater arctic char, find their way onto plates here, together with forest mushrooms, bushels of berries, including lingonberries and prized cloudberries, herbs and specialities such as tar. Finnish flavours can be found all over Helsinki, from a historic kauppahalli (covered market) to venerable restaurants, creative bistros and Michelin-starred gastronomy labs, in addition to international cuisines. While it's a culture-packed urban centre, Helsinki is surrounded by sublime natural environment that's easily reached from every part of the city. Opportunities to get active abound here, from boating to its archipelago's islands, strolling along its beaches and through its extensive parks and gardens, and hiking in its surrounding forests. When snow blankets the city in winter and the seas freeze, snowshoeing, cross-country and downhill skiing, ice skating and ice fishing on the many bays are all invigorating ways to keep warm while staying in touch with nature.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/84919753.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Finland,70,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,189934,"([('Sea Fortress Suomenlinna', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/11/16/3c/site-0583-0004-750-0.jpg'), ('Temppeliaukio Church', 'Also known as ""Church in the Rock,"" this modern church is carved from rock and has a stunning copper dome.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/42/e8/66/this-is-not-only-lutheran.jpg'), ('Seurasaari Island and Open-Air Museum', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/67/fc/61/seurasaaren-ulkomuseo.jpg'), ('Helsinki Cathedral', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0d/3c/53/de/caption.jpg'), ('Old Market Hall', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1b/0b/f1/c0/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Kamppi Chapel of Silence', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/08/96/84/20190621-134604-largejpg.jpg'), ('Uspenskin Cathedral (Uspenskin Katedraali)', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/93/db/2c/uspenskin-cathedral-helsinki.jpg'), ('Helsinki Tram System', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/8d/47/6b/travia.jpg'), ('Ateneum', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/09/0c/bf/67/caption.jpg'), ('Oodi Central Library', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/15/d4/98/f2/street-view.jpg'), ('The Esplanadi Park', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/e7/ac/e1/the-esplanadi-park.jpg'), ('The National Museum of Finland', ""National Museum illustrates Finnish history from medieval times to the 19th century.

70,kolkata-calcutta,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/kolkata-calcutta," India’s third-largest city is a daily festival of human existence, simultaneously noble and squalid, cultured and desperate, decidedly futuristic while splendid in decay.

71,munich,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/munich," Tall tankards and high-tech cars, edgy art and Lederhosen – Munich is a city where traditional and modern sit side by side like few places on earth. Beer has been part of Munich life for at least seven centuries and the brewing tradition is very much alive and kicking today. Nowhere else in Europe has a beer tradition quite like the Bavarian capital with six mammoth breweries pumping out world-class suds to hundreds of beer gardens and beer halls. And the climax to the Munich beer year is, of course, the famous Oktoberfest, attended by over six million people. Germany’s ‘purity law’ guarantees there’s nothing in your Mass (1L tankard) that shouldn’t be, so if you can lift the thing – ‘Prost!’ (Cheers!) Munich has long been known as the ‘city of art and beer’, so before you head off to the pub, take some time to savour the local art scene. The Kunstareal, Munich’s art quarter, is the place to start, with four major venues displaying everything from Dutch masters to 1960s design. The city also boasts some world-class museums focusing on topics as diverse as Oktoberfest, porcelain and BMW cars. And if that weren't enough, there are still royal palaces to explore – the legacy of 700 years of rule by a single family, the Wittelsbachs. The locals have a word for it – Gemütlichkeit – that untranslatable intermingling of cosiness, well-being and laid-back attitude. In Munich you will sense it most under the fairy lights of a summer beer garden, people-watching in the English Garden and behind the wheel of a BMW heading south. It may be just the local character, but a large share of Gemütlichkeit must come from the fact that the Bavarian capital is one of the most affluent cities on the planet, it’s economy larger than most small countries, its infrastructure well-tended. Munich’s various quirks, the things that make the city the place it is, might be what stick in the memory most. Whether it be the inebriated oompah band, that special knife for eating monster radishes, the Bavarians outrageous dialect, the mad hat traditions of the Oktoberfest or the surfers on the Eisbach wave – you’re sure to discover some freakish aspect of Munich life every day. And then there is the local garb – nowhere else in central Europe do the locals don their traditional costume – the famous Lederhosen and Dirndl – as readily as the Münchners, so why not join them?",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/59871922.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Germany,56,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187309,"([('Marienplatz', 'This prominent public square, the largest in Munich, still stands as the center of social activity in the city, much as it has throughout history.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/73/59/22/caption.jpg'), ('English Garden', 'Very popular scenic park, more internaitonal than its name would suggest, it contains a Greek temple, Chinese pagoda and Japanese tea house.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/08/a5/48/experience-munich-tour.jpg'), ('Nymphenburg Palace', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/ff/29/26/barocke-gartenanlage.jpg'), ('Allianz Arena', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/e6/8a/ad/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Residenz', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/3c/74/8d/antiquarium.jpg'), ('Viktualienmarkt', ""The city's largest and most famous outdoor marketplace."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/82/d2/65/viktualienmarkt.jpg'), ('Oktoberfest', ""A raucous celebration of Bavarian culture, Munich's Oktoberfest is one of the world's oldest, biggest, and longest parties.

72,stockholm,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sweden/stockholm," Stockholmers call their city 'beauty on water'. But despite the well-preserved historic core, Stockholm is no museum piece: it's modern, dynamic and ever-evolving. When it comes to cultural assets, Stockholm is scandalously rich. Take Gamla Stan. The city's oldest district is the stuff of storybooks. Complete with prerequisite royal palace, gabled buildings and razor-thin cobblestone streets, it's hands down one of Europe’s most enchanting, impeccably preserved historic centres. Across the city, world-class museums and galleries inform and provoke, harbouring everything from glittering Viking treasures and an ill-fated warship, to Abba props and subversive contemporary art. It's a stimulating, inspiring mix, where the past, present and future constantly merge, converse and engage. Stockholm's sense of style is legendary. Here, good design is not a luxury, it's a right – even the humblest coffee shop is usually design literate, from its lighting right down to its cups, bowls and cutlery. And while industrial design is a theme at several city museums, a fix of retail therapy can be equally enlightening. From cult-status local threads, bags and textiles, to delicate handmade ceramics, local objects reveal much about the Swedish love of understatement, functionality and harmony. If it's time to redesign your life, this is the city to do it in. Given the bounty of prime ingredients drawn from Stockholm's surrounding waters, fields and forests, it's not surprising that food is a serious passion. This is a city with a curious, open-minded palate. Whatever the global culinary trend, Stockholm is on it, from raw food and açai breakfast bowls to sustainable, locavore dining. Old-school, homegrown classics are equally revered. Whether it's fried herring, succulent meatballs or buttery toast skagen, traditions are both faithfully adhered to and cleverly tweaked, the latter by Stockholm's legion of young, ambitious, forward-thinking chefs. Stockholm is easy in all the right ways. Despite being spread across 14 islands, it's a relatively compact creature, and walking is often the best way to get around. Bridges connect most of the islands, while ferries and the tunnelbana (metro) link the rest. Public transport is safe, smooth and efficient, covering every corner of the city and its bucolic surrounds. It's also well adapted to wheelchair travel. Nearly all signs are written in Swedish and English, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a local who doesn't speak near-perfect English.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/iStock_000052984276XLarge.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Sweden,86,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,189852,"([('Vasa Museum', ""The Vasa ship capsized and sank in Stockholm 1628.

74,marrakesh,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/marrakesh," Prepare for your senses to be slapped. Marrakesh's heady sights and sounds will dazzle, frazzle and enchant. Put on your babouches (leather slippers) and dive right in. Bahia Palace and the Dar Si Said are a riot of tilework and intricate floral painted-wood ceilings, the Saadian Tombs are enriched by an opulent bounty of marble, while the Musée de Mouassine and Musée de Marrakech are a showcase of swirling stucco and carved-wood design. And if you choose to bed down for a night in a riad, you'll be able to sleep amid some of this splendour too. Marrakesh is a city steeped in ancient artistry that continues to thrive, kept alive by the modern craftspeople of the souqs and the contemporary art and design scene of the Ville Nouvelle. You’ll understand how religion permeates the rhythms of daily life when you hear the sonorous call to prayer echo out from the mosques. As an old imperial capital, Marrakesh is home to some beautiful examples of Islamic architecture, most impressively the Ali Ben Youssef Medersa and the Koutoubia minaret. The city also holds on to a heritage of the other religious communities that once helped it become a vibrant caravan town. Head to the old Jewish district of the mellah to visit the Lazama Synagogue and the Miaara Jewish cemetery to gain a greater understanding of Marrakesh's cosmopolitan past. Think of the medina's souqs as a shopping mall, but laid out according to a labyrinthine medieval-era plan. Whether you want to spice up your pantry with North African flavours or buy a carpet to add Moroccan-wow to your house, this magpie's nest of treasures is manna for shop-til-you-drop fanatics. Got your map ready? Well, it's probably of little use to you here. Wrapped within the 19 kilometres of powder-pink rammed-earth ramparts, the medina is Marrakesh's show-stopping sight of crowded souqs, where sheep carcasses swing from hooks next door to twinkling lamps, and narrow, doodling ochre-dusted lanes lead to nowhere. The main artery into this mazy muddle is the vast square of Djemaa El Fna, where it's carnival night every night. Stroll between snail vendors, soothsayers, acrobats and conjurers, musicians and slapstick acting troupes to discover the old city's frenetic pulse. The party doesn't end until the lights go out.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/96589435.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Morocco,14,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,293734,"([('Jardin Majorelle', 'Nicely designed and maintained gardens, similar to those of Generalife in Granada, Spain.

75,portland,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pacific-northwest/portland," Best coffee. Most food carts. Top craft breweries. Number-one hipster haven. Portland is a city of indie-spirited superlatives and humble, off-beat charms. Portland has a long-held reputation as one of the country's top culinary destinations – James Beard was born here, after all. The city's location north of the agriculturally fertile Willamette Valley and its close proximity to the Pacific Ocean yields a bounty of fresh ingredients, and a roster of top chefs makes for quality execution of innovative concepts. Compared to other major US cities, great meals don't have to break the bank, either, thanks to lower food shipping costs plus a wealth of affordable fast-casual establishments, a flourishing food-cart scene and hoards of cut-price happy-hour specials. Portland has an almost unfair abundance of natural beauty – perfect parks, leafy trees, vibrantly flowering shrubs lining pretty residential streets, the Willamette River meandering through town, and Mt Hood on the horizon. On a national scale, Portland is a pioneer in environmentally conscious public policy and progressive urban planning, and with some 30% of the city blanketed in tree canopy, the place literally feels like a breath of fresh air. The metro area boasts 37,000 acres of green space – which you'll catch Portlanders enjoying any time of the year, rain be damned. Scattered across five quadrants (yes, five; with a sixth in the works) Portland's neighborhoods are unique microcosms of hyperlocal culture. It's almost as if the city is made up of tons of small towns that got stapled together – each has a distinct sense of community and special character, and with just about everything you may need in each, you'll find locals hard pressed to venture far from home. From the hippie haunts of the Hawthorne District in Southeast to the upmarket eateries and boutiques of the Pearl District in Northwest, there's a 'hood for everyone here. 'Keep Portland Weird' – the slogan is plastered around town on bumper stickers, murals and signs, and in this bizzaro city, individuality, creativity and atypical lifestyles are celebrated. Naked bike rides, a vacuum cleaner museum, an adult soap-box derby, phallus-shaped doughnuts and a Darth Vader mask-wearing, flaming bagpipe-playing unicyclist for a local celeb are just a few examples of Portland's freak flags at full mast. In a city this open minded, self expression that can border on eccentric is met with a live-and-let live attitude, and oddballs are free to take up space.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/100631407.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,52024,"([('International Rose Test Garden', 'The oldest official, continuously operated public rose test garden in the United States boasts more than 8,000 roses.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/4a/ab/95/international-rose-test.jpg'), ('Portland Japanese Garden', 'Considered the most authentic Japanese Garden outside of Japan, the Portland Japanese Garden is a haven of tranquil beauty in all four seasons.

You hear the name--art museum, history museum, automobile museum--and you immediately know what you\'ll find there: objects, rare and wonderful; encounters with the unusual; beauty for beauty\'s sake. The specifics differ, but in each case, the collection takes center stage. Our name shows what we treasure, too, and it tells you how we\'re different. We\'re a museum that doesn\'t act like a museum because our audience--children and the adults who care for them--is more important to us than anything we collect. Indeed, our audience is the essential component that gives our exhibits meaning. Instead of investing in precious objects, we use familiar materials to craft priceless opportunities for children to learn through play. Our approach is inspired by the early childhood schools of Reggio Emilia, Italy; built on inquiry-based learning strategies; and influenced by a strong image of children as intelligent, creative, and resourceful. History Established in 1946. In 1946 visionary Portlander, Dorothea Lensch, founded the ""Junior Museum and Adventure House,"" as part of Portland Parks and Recreation. Lensch, who served as Portland\'s recreation director from 1937 to 1972, was particularly dedicated to meeting the needs of Portland\'s underserved communities. She developed innovative programs for children with special needs and for economically disadvantaged families, a legacy that lives on in our mission and core values. We moved to our current location in Washington Park in 2001, thanks to the incredible efforts of our partners including the Rotary Club of Portland and Portland Parks and Recreation. Our new building, the former home of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), is five times larger than the one we left behind, allowing us to expand our programs and add a school. In 2014 we completed Outdoor Adventure, opening new kinds of exploration and discovery to our community.

Québec City is one of North America’s oldest and most magnificent settlements. Its picturesque Old Town is a Unesco World Heritage site, a living museum of narrow cobblestone streets, 17th- and 18th-century houses and soaring church spires, with the splendid Château Frontenac hotel and city icon towering above it all. Even with a T-shirt shop on half the corners, there's more than a glimmer of Old Europe in its classic bistros, sidewalk cafes and manicured squares. History buffs will especially love Québec’s 19th-century hilltop Citadelle and two museums offering graphic representations of the battles between France and Britain for control of the city. Québec City has something else: the heart and soul of the province, the fiercest of grips on French-Canadian identity and the French language. It is something people here have fought and died for and something they treasure deep. Québécois grow up studying English, but because the anglophone minority here is so tiny – just 1.5% of the population speak English as their mother tongue – they rarely use it outside the major tourist areas. Most city residents are fully bilingual, but if you stray into the surrounding countryside, you’ll quickly find that French is the province’s official language. Québec City offers a fabulous dining scene and, thanks to the agricultural abundance of nearby Île d’Orléans and Côte de Beaupré, it is a locavore cuisine. The provincial capital goes to great lengths to entertain visitors. All summer long, musicians, acrobats and actors in period costume take to the streets, while fantastic festivals fill the air with fireworks and song. In the coldest months of January and February, Québec’s Winter Carnival is arguably the biggest and most colorful winter festival around. Fall and spring bring beautiful foliage, thinner crowds and dramatically reduced prices.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-481031831_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Canada,86.21,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,155033,"([('Old Quebec', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/99/e5/8f/old-quebec.jpg'), ('Parc de la Chute-Montmorency', 'These 275-foot falls on the Montmorency River tower higher than even the legendary Niagara Falls.

81,jakarta,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/jakarta," One of the world’s greatest megalopolises, Jakarta is a dynamic and vibrant city. Its chaotic charm and juxtapositions can be found on every street. An organism unto itself, Jakarta is a town in the midst of a very public metamorphosis and, despite the maddening traffic, life here is lived at speed, driven by an industriousness and optimism that's palpable. With this fast developing pace come challenges. It's no oil painting, yet beneath the new high-rises, relentless concrete, gridlocked streets, smattering of slums and a persistent blanket of smog, Jakarta has plenty of pleasant surprises, including a world-class food and coffee scene. Its citizens – even the poorest among them – remain good-natured and positive, and compared to many world capitals, crime levels are low. From the steamy, potent streets of Chinatown and Glodok to Kota’s vestiges of a colonial past, the old city is the prequel to Jakarta's development. The newer Merdeka Square is where Indonesia presents the face it wants the world to see: bold and confident. Further south, luxurious mega-developments are plopped next to humble neighbourhoods, with pockets of emerging art scenes and bohemian coffee shops. Across the city it’s possible to rub shoulders with Indonesia’s future leaders and thinkers in sleek restaurants and roof-top bars. Hedonists can go clubbing and drinking 'till dawn, much to the dismay of the current administration. In Jakarta, you can find all of Indonesia. It’s not just that people pour in from all corners looking for a better life (as they’ve done for centuries), it’s that they bring along their wonderful melange of cultures, beliefs and desires from the nation’s 17,000 islands. Walk down an alley with food stalls and you’ll find a huge diversity of flavours, while the glitzy malls and hotels offer fine dining from around the archipelago and the world. Meanwhile, goods come in from all over and are sold at shops and on street corners around the clock. Jakarta is where Indonesia puts on its best face. It has the country’s top museums, the greatest diversity of restaurants and public spaces in countless shopping malls that rival anything in Singapore or Bangkok. You can stroll the grand boulevard of Jl Thamrin when it's closed to vehicles on Sunday mornings and marvel at all that’s been built. Although religious pressure has slightly dimmed Jakarta’s reputation as a place to party beyond bounds, it is still a city where people can enjoy long nights in lounges and clubs or linger with gatherings of friends.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/76093313.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Indonesia,62,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,294229,"([('Grand Indonesia Mall', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/7c/75/d9/grand-indonesia-mall.jpg'), ('Istiqlal Mosque', ""Indonesia's largest mosque is a sacred place of worship as well as a center for conferences, lectures and seminars."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/c9/5b/b8/caption.jpg'), ('Ancol Dreamland', 'Dunia Fantasi means Dreamland in Indonesian.

82,tel-aviv,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/israel-and-the-palestinian-territories/mediterranean-coast/tel-aviv," Tel Aviv (meaning 'Hill of Spring' in Hebrew) has an air of perpetual renewal: flowers bloom, new restaurants open and there's always a party somewhere. When it comes to the world's best beach destinations, Tel Aviv remains largely unsung – but its strip of shimmering seashore, stretching 14km along the Mediterranean coast, is this city's crowning glory. From the celeb-laden sands of Metzitzim Beach in the north, down to the no-frills chill of Alma Beach bordering Jaffa in the south, a diverse set of Tel Avivian sun-chasers congregate daily for luminous sunsets that teeter close to holy. And for this primarily secular subset of the country's residents, witnessing such a sight may just be the closest thing known to worship. Hedonism is the main religion in this hip, bustling Mediterranean 'Manhattan' – there's no shortage of options for finding a party fit to your tastes. Usher in the night at a beachfront watering hole, sip wine with sophisticated city slickers at swanky lounges, or chill with a hand-crafted creation at a themed cocktail bar – and that's all before dinner. This city runs on little sleep, with an after-dark culture centred on jovial rooftop rounds, live music at neighbourhood dives and international DJs spinning bumping beats at underground clubs. A few days here is fun, but a week can be a revelation. Modern, vibrant and cosmopolitan, Tel Aviv is characterised by an enterprising creative landscape. From the world-class Tel Aviv Museum of Art, which houses works by international greats, to the secluded street art alleys and avant-garde galleries scattered around bohemian Florentin, inspiration comes in myriad mediums. And it doesn't end with the visual arts – there's plenty of performance, too. Enjoy the rich theatre scene, live music ranging from beachside buskers to big name international acts, and plenty of classical music, opera and ballet for high culture cats. Tel Aviv's 'White City' – the central area of town that saw rapid development by German-Jewish architects who fled Nazi persecution in the 1930s – is home to more buildings in the Bauhaus architecture style than any city in the world. Preservation of more than 1000 of the original 4000 structures earned the area an Unesco World Heritage Site designation in 2003. Despite many of the beloved buildings falling into a state of disrepair throughout the years, their style has become emblematic of Tel Aviv and efforts to restore them to their former glory carry on today.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/8ec64b64e1d0805b1101f6c70c7f5b31-tel-aviv.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Israel,84.97,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,293984,"([('Neve Tzedek', 'Filled with a maze of narrow winding streets, this picturesque neighborhood is considered one of Tel Aviv’s major cultural areas where the Frederic Mann Auditorium, Helena Rubinstein Art Museum and Israel’s Habima Theater are located.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9e/78/7d/caption.jpg'), ('Tayelet', 'This is the paved beachside walkway which provides a 2km path between Tel Aviv and Jaffa.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/6c/83/71/photo1jpg.jpg'), ('Tel Aviv Museum of Art', 'This museum features a rich collection of art including European works from the 16th to 19th centuries, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and 20th-century modernism.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2c/ee/da/the-new-tel-aviv-museum.jpg'), ('Jaffa Old City', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/10/4c/e1/jaffa-old-city.jpg'), (""Carmel Market (Shuk Ha'Carmel)"", 'Tel Aviv’s biggest and busiest marketplace is filled with colorful stalls and shouting vendors selling a variety of goods, from dried fruits and exotic spices to clothing and footwear.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/f8/31/10/fergq.jpg'), ('Sarona Market', ""Sarona Market is Israel's largest indoor culinary market and operates seven days a week.

85,oslo,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/oslo," Surrounded by mountains and sea, this compact, cultured and fun city has a palpable sense of reinvention. Come to Oslo to pay homage to Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, the city’s two most famous sons, by all means. But don’t leave without discovering something of its contemporary cultural life too. Explore one of its many museums, get to know its booming contemporary-art scene at one of its commercial galleries or just marvel at the work of its starchitects. You can also walk the neighbourhoods that may already be familiar via the works of Karl Ove Knausgård, whose autobiographical novel series Min Kamp are set here, along with the mean streets of Norwegian-noir crime writers Jo Nesbø and Anne Holt. Oslo's skyline might be crowded by cranes but this rapidly growing urban metropolis is also one of the world’s most overwhelmingly green cities. It has earned the honour of being named European Green Capital for 2019, via one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world, excellent and well-patronised public transport, and a real commitment to sustainable food production and green space. The city is blessed with a large number of bucolic parks, and the Oslofjord’s waterways and islands are just minutes away from the centre, as are the ski slopes and forests of Nordmarka. Once known only for hot dogs and high prices, Oslo’s culinary scene is currently enjoying a Neo Nordic moment in the sun, and has become a culinary destination in its own right. This delicious change takes in everything from the most northern three-Michelin-starred restaurant in the world (Maaemo) to its deservedly hyped neighbourhood coffee scene and fabulous fusion cuisine, to the celebration of traditional favourites such as peel-and-eat shrimp, and, yes, even polse (hot dogs). The city also has a penchant for sushi and pizza, both of which can now compete on the world stage. Has Oslo become Scandinavia's late-night party hot spot? Wander Møllegata on a Wednesday and you might be convinced it is.

86,glasgow,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/glasgow," Disarmingly blending sophistication and earthiness, Scotland's biggest city has evolved over the last couple of decades to become one of Britain's most intriguing metropolises. Glasgow's principal architectural legacy is its impressive assemblage of stately Victorian mansions and public buildings, the product of wealth generated from manufacturing and trade. It gives the centre a solid, slightly staid dignity that is actually rather misleading. More svelte are the sublime designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, which dot the city; visiting a few of his buildings and interiors soon reveals his genius. The city – always proud of its working-class background – also innovatively displays its industrial heritage, while modern structures, many along the Clyde River, have quickly become local icons. Collecting was big in Victorian times, so it's no surprise that Glasgow's architectural legacy from the period is complemented by some wonderful museums and galleries. Kelvingrove combines natural history and diverse objects from around the world with a first-rate art collection, while nearby Kelvin Hall will hold, from 2020, the University of Glasgow's eclectic Hunterian museum exhibits, paintings and sumptuous Mackintosh interior. On the Clyde, the Riverside holds an excellent ensemble of historic vehicles; to the south, the Burrell Collection (due to reopen in 2020) is an extraordinary corpus of archaeological treasures, objets d'art from around the world and fine paintings. Glaswegians definitely work to live, and the city comes into its own after five – not that people don't pop down for a cheeky lunchtime pint, too. The city's pubs are gloriously friendly places and you're sure to have some entertaining blethers (chats) with locals when you pop into one. Glasgow's live music scene is also legendary; big bands play at iconic venues, but a number of lower-key pubs have regular gigs that are excellent too. Clubbing is also popular, with a couple of famous dance floors, and the LGBT-focused Pink Triangle is a notably friendly scene. Glasgow is where Scotland shops; the city packs out at weekends when highlanders, islanders, Edinburghers and more come in to cruise the malls. The downtown area has several major shopping centres and arcades fully stocked with global brands as well as more local offerings. On the fringes of this area and in the West End are the bohemian beats: record stores, vintage clothing markets and second-hand booksellers. In the East End, the weekend Barras market is quite an experience, blending modern concepts with cheap designer ripoffs, faded bric-a-brac and a dose of authentic working-class Glasgow.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-114206339_full.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Kingdom,97.74,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,186534,"([('Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum', ""Free Entry.

89,hamburg,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/hamburg," When all's said and done, Hamburg's appeal can be narrowed down to one simple calling card: Welcome to one of the coolest cities on earth. Hamburg's historic label, ‘The gateway to the world’, might be a bold claim, but Germany’s second-largest city and biggest port has never been shy. A leading light in the Hanseatic League in the Middle Ages, Hamburg became a centre of international trade, a legacy that continues today: it remains one of Germany's wealthiest cities and Hamburg’s maritime spirit still infuses the entire city. It's the sort of city where echoes of the city's port and history are everywhere, from the incessant cry of gulls overhead to the vibrant neighbourhoods awash with multicultural eateries, seaward-facing architecture and the gloriously seedy Reeperbahn red-light district. There was one consolation for locals when the city's authorities decided to blow the municipal budget: at least it was done for a new concert hall, the Elbphilharmonie. Hamburg's musical pedigree is staggering: Gustav Mahler once directed the city's 330-year-old state opera, while both Johannes Brahms and Felix Mendelssohn were born here. But it's not just about classical music. Hamburg also has very modern and rather raucous melodic soundtrack, not mention a compelling story. The city nurtured the early promise of the Beatles, and music festivals litter the calendar, while the dynamic live music scene just keeps getting better. The Elbphilharmonie is an extraordinary structure, dominating the skyline and capturing in glass and brick the essence of Hamburg's polyglot soul. This striking icon of the city has elevated architecture to the centre of public debate and awareness, and it's just the most famous of a rather exciting collection. Office towers that appear as if they are dancing and buildings that from afar look like ocean liners share the streets with half-timbered relics of the medieval city. And only in Hamburg would they think of preserving a former WWII bunker and turning it into a nightclub. The good people of Hamburg really know how to live. For a start, they've mastered the ingredients of culinary diversity: elevate your local specialties to the level of an obsession and treasure them, even as you remain open to all manner of gastronomic trends. The result is culinary excellence on multiple fronts. So, too, for nightlife: Hamburg is full to bursting with classy cocktail bars, dance-all-night clubs and neighbourhood bars and pubs that both reflect each neighbourhood's identity and define it. So successful are they that it's almost impossible to come to Hamburg and not have a really good time.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-519092007_medium.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Germany,56,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187331,"([('Miniatur Wunderland', 'Miniatur Wunderland is the world’s largest model train exhibit, and still growing.

90,belfast,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ireland/northern-ireland/belfast," A former industrial powerhouse with a troubled past, Belfast has pulled off a remarkable transformation into a hip party town. These days the Titanic is so closely connected to Belfast's identity that there is a whole neighbourhood named after the ill-fated liner: the shipyards where Titanic was constructed are now part of the Titanic Quarter. At its centre is the stunning, star-shaped edifice of Titanic Belfast, a state-of-the-art multimedia museum that has become the city's number-one tourist draw. Around it are several other sites with links to the Titanic, and the former drawing offices of the Harland & Wolff shipping company are now part of the Titanic Hotel. No visitor to Belfast leaves without learning something about that ship. Belfast's nightlife is often loud, sometimes intoxicating and always fun. From traditional pubs to sleek cocktail bars to crowded clubs, the scene is generally friendly and accessible. At weekends, locals and out-of-towners converge in the Cathedral Quarter, where the party spills out into the streets. Many bars have live music, ranging from informal traditional sessions to jazz, blues and folk music, ukulele jams, and crowd-pleasing cover bands. No matter what day you visit, there will be live music somewhere and a pub open and ready to serve you a drink. There are so many excellent restaurants in Belfast that the biggest problem might be choosing between them: there just aren't enough mealtimes to sample them all. Fresh produce from nearby farms and seafood from local ports is transformed into sublime dishes in restaurant kitchens. From high-end seasonal tasting menus to innovative fusion cooking, creativity is rife. Not to be outdone, craft brewers and gin distillers in and around the city contribute to an ever expanding menu of local beverages. As well as innovative new cooking, Belfast's restaurants still do the traditional stuff pretty well too. Bring an appetite! Belfast's rich cultural heritage is reflected in its vibrant theatres, world-class musicians and thriving visual arts scene. In the Cathedral Quarter, international and local street artists have brightened the neighbourhood with their thought-provoking work, while the quarter's Black Box and MAC arts centres foster local talent. The annual Belfast Film Festival showcases the work of local and international film makers and the Belfast International Arts Festival is one of the largest arts festivals in the UK and Ireland. In May, the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival brings music, drama, poetry, street theatre and art to the neighbourhood.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/dcedfba10a58d98a039661b1496b14de-queen-s-university.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Kingdom,97.74,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,186470,"([('Crumlin Road Gaol', ""The Crumlin Road Gaol dates back to 1845 and closed it's doors as a working prison in 1996.

We taste 8-10 of our handcrafted cheeses, along with homemade crackers, breads, chutneys, plus our carefully selected house wines.

106,santo-domingo,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominican-republic/santo-domingo," Santo Domingo, or ‘La Capital’ as it’s typically called, is a collage of cultures and neighborhoods. It’s where the sounds of life – domino pieces slapped on tables, backfiring mufflers and horns from chaotic traffic, merengue blasting from corner stores – are most intense. At the heart of the city is the Zona Colonial, where you’ll find one of the oldest churches and the oldest surviving European fortress, among other New World firsts. Amid the cobblestone streets it would be easy to forget Santo Domingo is in the Caribbean. But this is an intensely urban city, home not only to colonial-era architecture, but also to hot clubs, vibrant cultural institutions and elegant restaurants.

107,atlanta,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/atlanta," The South's so-called capital isn't nicknamed Hotlanta for nothing, y'all. Charismatic and lush, Atlanta is a feverish, easy-on-the-eyes cavalcade of culture, cuisine and Southern hospitality. With more than six million residents in the metro and outlying areas, Atlanta continues to experience explosive growth thanks to domestic transplants and international immigrants alike. Beyond the big-ticket Downtown attractions you will find a constellation of superlative restaurants, a palpable Hollywood influence (Atlanta is a hugely popular film-production center) and iconic African American history. That last point can't be overstated: any nationwide African American intellectual, political and artistic movement you can mention either had its genesis in Atlanta, or found a center of gravity here. Without natural boundaries to control development, it's fair to say Atlanta is more a region than a city. Yet for all its sprawl and suburbanization, there is a lovely urban core covered with trees – some 36% of the city to be exact, making it one of the most densely forested cities in the US. Magnificent oaks, Southern pines, dogwoods and magnolias pepper the nation's ninth largest metro area, a refuge for 343 parks, nature preserves, gardens and public spaces. Among the green is the ongoing Atlanta BeltLine, transforming the city's urban core and cutting a cinematic path through the canopy. Martin Luther King Jr, the quintessential figure of the Civil Rights movement and arguably America's greatest leader, was born and raised in Atlanta, the son of a preacher and choir leader. His lineage was significant not only because he followed his father to the pulpit of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, but also because his political speeches rang out with a preacher's inflections. King remains one of the most respected figures of the 20th century and is Atlanta's quintessential African American hero, his legacy emblazoned across the city's historic Sweet Auburn district, home to the Martin Luther King Jr National Historic Site. Atlanta is a quirky and cultured metroplex, with world-class museums, theater and arts. The economy is robust, the population is young and creative, and the social scene is refreshingly diverse. Distinct neighborhoods are like friendly small towns, rife with pristinely preserved historic homes and thoroughfares of hip bars, cozy coffee shops and independent shopping. And the food? Be it classic Southern eats such as pecan pie, fried chicken and pimento cheese; innovative, chef-driven New American foodie haunts; or ethnic holes-in-the-wall, Atlanta's dining scene is a culinary juggernaut.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/41890a1aff2c7a93d3d973db4ed08065-atlanta.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,60898,"([('Atlanta Botanical Garden', 'Step into a world of magic and serenity at the Atlanta Botanical Garden, where features like the Fuqua Orchid Center treat visitors to a rare collection of high-elevation orchids never before grown in the southeast.

111,austin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/austin," With a population that’s rapidly approaching a million, and an annual influx of almost 30 million visitors, Austin is by any standards a big city. Somehow, though, Texas' state capital has kept its small-town heart, earning the love with great music, culinary prowess, whip-smart locals and a sociable streak impossible to resist. The city easily earns its title of 'Live Music Capital of the World.' Two music festivals, South by Southwest (SXSW) and the Austin City Limits Festival, earn international acclaim, but quality live performances go down every single night in one of the countless clubs, bars and restaurants. Heck, there's even an awesome band during chicken shit bingo at Ginny's Little Longhorn Saloon on Sunday afternoons. Country music singer-songwriters are the classic draw, but blues, rock, hip-hop and jazz bands also take the stage. Dancing is encouraged. As the sign says at the Broken Spoke: Please do NOT !!!! Stand on the dance floor. On a sunny morning in the spring, Lady Bird Lake looks like the world's most active playground. Kayakers skim across the still water, swimmers swim laps in Barton Springs pool, frisbees whir across a lush disc golf course and joggers and cyclists burn calories on lakeside trails. Austin is home to more than 300 parks, with more than 30 miles of urban trails open to runners, walkers and cyclists. Nearly 50 more miles are in the works. And they are all well-used. A popular hike-and-bike trail loops around Lady Bird Lake and links to a creekside greenbelt, adding water sports to the mix. The best part about the food scene? It never takes itself too seriously. Just look at all those busted-up food trucks, some of them serving the most exquisitely flavored bites in the country. The line at what may be the best barbecue joint in the US is a communal party, with staff selling beer to the outdoor queue. And menus at the fanciest farm-to-table restaurants often get downright whimsical. Overall, there's not much food snobbery here. But passion? Yes. Ice cream. BBQ. Tacos. Locals love to opine. Take a few bites, join the conversation. Despite the growth, Austin has managed to maintain a cooperative and hospitable atmosphere. We've seen food truck operators give recommendations to folks in line about other great places to eat. Small business owners share advice with newbie competitors. And people of all ages will socialize with the merest of provocation. No one is a stranger for long. Even the city government has heart, deciding to forgive parking tickets for partiers who leave their cars downtown after a night of fun. In sum, despite her popularity, Austin hasn't forgotten where she came from. In fact, she loves it mightily.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/043f74a30ac1bd070e9af81a8c134d1d-austin.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United States,95.46,Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions,30196,"([('Texas State Capitol', ""If it's in Texas, it must be bigger and better.

119,sofia,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bulgaria/sofia," Bulgaria's pleasingly laid-back capital is often overlooked by visitors heading to the coast or the ski resorts, but they're missing something special. Sofia is no grand metropolis, but it's a modern, youthful city, with a scattering of onion-domed churches, Ottoman mosques and stubborn Red Army monuments that lend an eclectic, exotic feel. Excavation work carried out during construction of the metro unveiled a treasure trove of Roman ruins from nearly 2000 years ago, when the city was called 'Serdica'. Away from the buildings and boulevards, vast parks and manicured gardens offer a welcome respite, and the ski slopes and hiking trails of mighty Mt Vitosha are just a short bus ride from the centre.

It was an important commercial and political centre, large and well developed city, built in a Roman style with large stone streets, a forum, beautiful temples and impressive buildings with magnificent decorations.In 2004 during the construction works in the city center of Sofia unexpectedly came across a part of a Roman wall. Archaeological excavations immediately started – thus the Amphitheatre of Serdica (Amphiteatrum Serdicense) was discovered! This is a monumental public building with an elliptical layout and an arena in the middle, elliptically surrounded by the tiered seats for the spectators. The great number of coins and pottery discovered enabled the researchers to identify two periods in III-IV century. During the research on the site it became evident that about 5 meters under the amphitheatre there is a theatre, built in II-III century, i.e. 100 years earlier. A unique complex combining ancient amphitheatre and theatre was discovered. These are the largest buildings from the age of ancient Serdica, evidencing its heyday during the centuries. The finding was declared unique and the discovery - unmatched in the world!The Arena of Serdica is 60.5 m long and 43 m wide. However, the Amphitheatre of Serdica is the only one in the world, combining a Roman theatre and a late antique amphitheatre in one place and the only such public building in the Balkans. This makes the site truly unique and the discovery - sensational. It is a fact that no other capital or even city in the world can boast a theatre and amphitheatre together and located in its very centre. Its construction began during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian and was completed by the Emperor Constantine the Great.Interesting Facts:- The first evidence for the existence of an amphitheatre with arena for fights is a stone plate found in 1919 near the present-day building of the Council of Ministers. It is assumed that it served as an “advertising banner” at the entrance of the ancient Serdica. Nowadays it is preserved and is on display in the Archaeological Museum in Sofia.- The plate reveals images of lions, tigers, bulls, crocodiles, which took part in combat with Gladiators. The Christians persecuted at this time were thrown to the wild beasts for the amusement of the spectators. The excavations revealed teeth of bear.- The amphitheatre was located outside the fortress walls of the ancient town and now it is located in the centre of Sofia.- Its walls have been preserved in their actual form and the combat arena is covered with sand as it was in the past. The origin of the word “arena” is from the Latin word for sand “harena”. The sand was selected as the most suitable material to absorb the blood of the victims.- When standing in the ruins of the amphitheatre and looking up at the street level, it becomes evident how ages and nature have deposited a new layer of about 12 m between the town of Serdika from III century and the modern city.- The walls of the amphitheatre and the sectors with seats were about 5 floors high and correspond to the level of the nowadays Moskovska Street. About 25,000 spectators gathered on the site. Its opposite end is found to be near the Youth Theatre on Dondukov Blvd.- 7 stone seats for spectators are preserved and placed in their original locations.- Here the dressing rooms of the actors involved in theatrical performances can be seen, as well as the entrance of the east gate, where the chariots passed during the gladiatorial combat.- Clad in metal and leather, people from all over the empire used to die or gain their freedom on the arena.Besides the metallic clink of weapons, the ruins remembered recitations of poets and orators, virtuoso performances of musicians and actors, exalted cheers of spectators.- Clay tiles still bear the footprints of animals - goats, dogs, cats, immortalized their traces in the uncured slabs of the ancient builders.A dwelling and a furnace dated V-VI century and a well dated IV-V century were also discovered.Superstructures built during the age of the Ottoman Empire were found, as well as coins and pottery from this period. Legends about the Emperor Diocletian – the creator of the Amphitheatre of Serdica - Diocletian was characterized with his lust for power, serious and pensive look, as if contemplating great deals. It had been predicted that he would reach the supreme power after killing a boar, so he repeatedly went hunting. - When seized power, Diocletian reserved for himself the eastern empire and the position of senior co-emperor. He took the name Jovius – from the name of god Jove, Jupiter. - Diocletian first introduced as mandatory the complex royal ceremonies followed by almost all the emperors after him, aimed at enhancing the power and limiting the access to the autocrats deified while still alive. - After the solemn abdication of Diocletian - the only emperor who retired voluntarily - it turns out that it was only his authority that protected the Tetrarchy from collapsing. - Diocletian spent the last years of his life in his huge palace, which was built near his hometown of Aspalatos (today's city of Split) in Dalmatia. According to legend, when some messengers came to him with a request to return to power again, he replied to them that “if they knew what vegetables he himself grew in his garden, they would never ask him to become the Emperor again”."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/76/bb/62/amphitheatre-of-serdica.jpg'), ('Dragalevtsi Monastery', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/7b/7b/b6/esterno.jpg'), ('Seven Rila Lakes', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/2a/64/9a/photo6jpg.jpg'), ('Sofia History Museum', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/af/46/cc/sofia-history-museum.jpg'), ('Kvadrat 500', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0e/98/80/d6/national-gallery-square.jpg'), ('Museum of Socialist Art', 'The Museum of Socialist Art (MSA) opened on September 19th 2011 as part of the structure of the National Museum of Bulgarian Art and is under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture.

120,bordeaux,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/southwestern-france/bordeaux," An intoxicating cocktail of 18th-century savoir-faire, millennial hi-tech and urban street life, France's sixth largest city is among Europe's most exciting and gutsy players. This is the world's largest urban World Heritage Site, cradling half the city (18 sq km) in its Unesco-listed treasure chest. From the elegant symmetry of place de la Bourse, palaces strung with stone-sculpted mascarons (faces), to tree-shaded boulevards laced with hôtels particuliers (mansions) built for 18th-century wine merchants, Bordeaux architecture is world-class. Contemporary architects continue the trend for excellence, with breathtakingly wild and beautiful creations resembling giant wine decanters, gleaming white pebbles, all sorts. An interesting portfolio of art museums embracing all periods and genres is the icing on the cake to this magnificent architectural heritage. Striding through Bordeaux on its leggy route north past traditional wine-producing chateaux to the Atlantic Ocean, the River Garonne is never far away. From this Gallo-Roman city's golden past as medieval wine trader and key port in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment, to the prestigious vineyards and vibrant quayside culture the river fuels today, the Garonne has been the city's lifeline since birth. Be it strolling, jogging or cycling along the silky-smooth water's edge in a loop from Left to Right Bank, lounging over drinks on a riverside terrace or cruising along the water, Bordeaux's riverside riches merit your full attention. This is a wine capital hemmed in by green, sun-drenched vineyards. Viticulture here is an ancient art and tradition bearing its own unique trademarks and no other vineyards in the world produce as much fine wine. Best up, from celebrated premiers crus aged for years to the very first vin nouveau cracked open at festivals after the autumnal harvest, dégustation (tasting) is an intrinsic part of daily life. Paired with the city's exceptional dining scene – a sassy mix of traditional French kitchens, experimental neobistros, creative fusion restaurants, food trucks and barista-run coffee shops – there is no tastier marriage. Santé! It's hard to believe that this was a city that fell under British rule for three hundred years (from the coronation of Henry of Aquitaine as King Henry II of England in 1152). Staunchly Bordelais to the last breath, Bordeaux enjoys an overwhelming sense of local pride and savoir faire. Innovation is her middle name and a high-spirited, university-student population bolsters the compelling undercurrent of creativity rippling through the city. Peppering a tramline with monumental pieces of contemporary art, partying in a WWII submarine bunker, and dancing on a barge at the industrial wet docks is all second nature to this natural bon vivant.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/88937597.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,France,39,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187079,"([('Place de la Bourse', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/a6/07/1e/caption.jpg'), ('The Water Mirror', 'The ""Miroir d\'Eau"" is less than 10 years old, but located just across from a monument nearly 3 centuries old, it has become one of the city\'s main attractions.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/e3/d6/d6/miroir-d-eau-de-bordeaux.jpg'), ('St. Andre Cathedral', ""This beautiful 17th century church is one of Bordeaux's main attractions."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/eb/c5/62/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Musee du Vin et du Negoce', 'Come discover three centuries of history and fame of the great wines of Bordeaux!

Following the invasion of the Southern Zone in November 1942, the Germans requisitioned the prison and placed it under their exclusive control. Montluc then became an internment camp for members of the resistance, hostages, and victims of the racial persecution, prior to their transfer to Drancy and subsequent deportation to the concentration and extermination camps. Montluc operated in daily contact with the Gestapo headquarters, Avenue Berthelot, in the buildings of the Military School of Medicine, where interrogations were carried out (current site of the Resistance and Deportation History Centre). Prisoners were generally deported or shot around Lyon and the DOUA. On the 24th of August the prisoners were released, partly due to Resistance intervention and partly due to the departure of the prison guards, one week before the liberation of Lyon on the 3rd of September.

152,nice,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/nice," With its mix of real-city grit, old-world opulence, year-round sunshine, vibrant street life and stunning seaside location, no place in France compares with Nice. Before everything else, there was the sea, and the Mediterranean climate – the twin factors that made Nice a tourist magnet as early as the 1700s. Look around and you’ll find the same elemental attractions that drew Europe's belle-époque aristocrats to promenade along the waterfront in horse-drawn carriages. Even now, nothing compares to the simple joy of a balmy beach day interspersed with a spot of people-watching astride the Promenade des Anglais' famous blue chairs. Whether you're skating, kayaking, swimming, sprawled on a beach lounger or transfixed by sunset over the ever-present Med, it's all still happening by the water. For any lover of French and Italian culture, Nice is the perfect hybrid. Long affiliated with Piedmont and Liguria to the east, Savoy to the north and Sardinia to the south, this city only joined France in 1860 and has always kept one foot in Italy. The Italian influence remains palpable everywhere, in Vieux Nice's tall-shuttered, ochre-hued buildings that look airlifted straight in from Portofino, in the fresh pasta shops on every corner and even in the football cheer Issa Nissa! (Go Nice!), shouted in the local Nissart dialect that’s been coloured by Ligurian Italian as much as Occitan French. The Côte d'Azur has ensnared many a visitor with the beauty of its light. Not least Henri Matisse, who came here to convalesce from bronchitis. When the sun finally emerged after a month of wintry drizzle, Matisse was so smitten that he made Nice his home for the next 37 years. Chagall, Picasso and Renoir also fell in love with this place, and Nice was later home to the influential avant-garde École de Nice. Art museums abound throughout the region, but Nice's three superstars – the Musées Matisse, Chagall and d’Art Moderne – are reason enough to justify an aesthetic pilgrimage here. Bring your appetite when you come to Nice. This city is meant for epicures. It all starts at Vieux Nice’s Saleya market, where small producers from the Alpine foothills bring in a bounty of fresh produce, and top chefs from surrounding restaurants shop right beside tourists. The city celebrates its uniqueness with street snacks like socca (chickpea pancakes), pissaladière (caramelised onion tart) or tourte de blettes (chard, raisin and pine nut pie), while its countless cosy bistros serve everything from hearty Provençal beef stew to true salade niçoise to pasta with pistou, and from fresh lemon tart to vegan cheesecake.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/3cb45f6e59190e8213ce0a35394d0e11-nice.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,France,39,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187234,"([('Old Town', 'This historic part of Nice feels like a medieval village with narrow streets curving between old buildings with red-tile roofs, small restaurants and open-markets.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/04/16/43/photo0jpg.jpg'), ('Castle Hill of Nice', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/06/04/e2/f5/nice-panoramic-over-view.jpg'), ('Promenade des Anglais', ""This famous street travels along Nice's Mediterranean waterfront."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/09/fd/09/6d/promenade-des-anglais.jpg'), ('Marc Chagall National Museum', 'This museum has a large collection of works by Marc Chagall, the famous Russian-born painter and designer.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/23/96/b1/caption.jpg'), ('Place Massena', ""A picturesque city square in Nice's historic quarter."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/75/ed/01/place-massena-4.jpg'), ('Cathedrale Saint-Nicolas a Nice', 'This Russian cathedral was built in the early 20th century in honor of the son of Aleksandr II tsarevich Nicolai, who died in Nice after failing to recover from tuberculosis.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/95/28/c2/caption.jpg'), ('Marche aux Fleurs Cours Saleya', 'This popular open-air marketplace features flowers, food items, produce and live fowl directly from the neighboring farms.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/ba/1e/c2/marche-cours-saleya-a.jpg'), ('Cathedrale Sainte-Reparate', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/12/38/72/5b/la-cathedrale-sainte.jpg'), ('Musee Massena', 'The Masséna Musee, the architectural jewel of the Promenade des Anglais, evokes through its collections the art and history of the Riviera from the time of the attachment of Nice to France until the end of the Belle Epoque.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/10/6c/53/07/la-villa-massena.jpg'), ('Place Garibaldi', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/06/f9/73/33/place-garibaldi.jpg'), ('Parc forestier du Mont-Boron', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/c6/bc/f0/parc-forestier-du-mont.jpg'), ('Phoenix Parc Floral de Nice', 'Fantastic floral and animal park as well as the beautiful Museum of Asian Art of the city of Nice. 5 hectare of greenery just in front of Nice airport.

Situated on the top of the Panchagiri Hills, 36km southwest of Bangalore, near Udipalya village, the campus is an ideal location for reflection and rejuvenation. Started in 1986 and spread over 65 acres, the campus has an abundance of flowering foliage spread along winding footpaths, a peaceful lake and the exquisitely beautiful Vishalakshi Mantap, the central meditation hall. Satsangs, held every evening, are gatherings where different minds unite through music, meditation, and wisdom to experience an elevated state of consciousness. Through Seva (voluntary service) one can experience the humble satisfaction of doing selfless work here, from serving food in the kitchen to keeping the premises clean to working in the various departments that focus on various projects and the ashram's upkeep. The Vishalakshi Mantap, named after 'Amma', Sri Sri's mother, is the main Meditation Hall in the form of a fully blossomed 1000 petal lotus. Its reflective dome that mirrors the sun during the day is lit up at night to a synchronized change of colored lights. The dome and golden spire that can be viewed from all parts of the sprawling campus grounds play the role of a compass - lending a sense of navigation to the spiritual seeker. Courses are held in various rooms at different levels of the mantap and satsangs are held on the main level. Each level opens onto a gallery. Following a circular design, the levels provide an excellent view of the campus grounds and the open grounds and hills in the distance. Built on a smaller scale, is the Sumeru Mantap in the more secluded, old ashram campus. When the campus was newly set up, and there was a much smaller gathering of people, satsangs were held here. It is a circular 3 tiered gallery with a garden in the center and the sky for a roof, dominated by a large densely foliaged banyan tree in the center. The Radha Kund gardens recapture the mystical garden of Vrindavan, replete with a pair of elephants, a pair of geese, a deer, some rabbits and a number of exotic birds! This is an excellent place to observe various birds as they sweep over the lake - and a good place to unwind, reflect and take stock of one's life. From the gardens one can hear the Sanskrit chantings of the boys at the Gurukul nearby. The seven year training program at the Gurukul teaches students how to conduct temple rituals. The course syllabus also includes study of the Veda, Agama, Sanskrit, Astrology, Yoga, music, Sculpture, Epics and scriptures. The Goshala, home to over 250 cows, is an important project undertaken to preserve the native breed of Indian cows. The cows enjoy human company and visitors receive great pleasure brushing and petting the cows. For those who wish to simply relax, The Sri Sri Ayurveda Panchakarma (Wellness Spa) offers the ideal retreat for body and mind. Apart from the super ambience and food, one can select from a number of rejuvenating therapy packages the spa offers. On campus is a very popular, vibrant eatery, The Vishala Cafe that serves Indian and Continental fast food. It is here that youngsters like to meet, relax, exchange ideas, play the piano or eat a filling meal while reading from the selection of books displayed at the cafe. An array of shops are also present on campus - two Divine shops (selling music and books), The Divine Services (a provision store), Madhurya (traditional artefacts, gifts), Sri Kriti (a boutique that sells hand made products by rural women and traditional craftmen) and Sri Sri Agriculture with its fresh produce of fruits and vegetables grown on campus.

174,oxford,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/oxfordshire/oxford," With its honey-coloured colleges arrayed in splendour beside the river, the university town of Oxford is a seductive vision of medieval learning and modern charm. Although there’s more to Oxford than Oxford University, the university is very much the city’s defining feature. Consistently ranked among the world’s most prestigious academic institutions, the university can trace its history back to the 11th century. Within 200 years, it had taken shape as a loose association of independent colleges, and that medieval institution remains recognisable to this day. Modern visitors flock to Oxford to explore those same colleges, housed for the most part in their original historic buildings, and to admire shared university resources such as the magnificent Bodleian Library and the world-class Ashmolean Museum. A gloriously mellow ensemble of golden-hued wonders, Oxford unquestionably ranks among England’s most beautiful cities. In fact, as you stroll through its historic and homogenous core, it can be hard to believe you’re in modern England at all. Certain specific buildings stand out, like the domed and glowing Radcliffe Camera, and you can admire masterpieces by such great architects as Sir Christopher Wren and Nicholas Hawksmoor. Really, though, the joy of visiting Oxford lies in the sheer cumulative splendour of college after century-old college, each playing its own permutation of Gothic chapels, secluded cloisters, and tranquil quadrangles. City of dreaming spires, or city of inspiring dreamers? Oxford authors have an extraordinary record for producing epic works of fantasy, imbued with dreamy, otherworldly qualities. The city would still look familiar to former dons such as Lewis Carroll, author of Alice In Wonderland, and JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, responsible for The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia respectively. Wind in the Willows author Kenneth Grahame went to school in Oxford, while Philip Pullman’s trilogy, His Dark Materials, revolves around alternative versions of the city. Even Dr Seuss (Theodore Geisel) was here, studying literature at Lincoln College. As befits a city of students and professors, Oxford is one of the last bastions of the great British pub. Irresistible old pubs dotted down its central lanes and alleyways include the charmingly convoluted Turf Tavern, the Bear Inn and the King’s Arms. Some double as literary landmarks, like the Lamb & Flag and the Eagle & Child, near neighbours and regular haunts of the ‘Inklings’, a group of writers that included CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien. Yet more lie out in the surrounding countryside, reached by idyllic riverside walks, like The Perch, The Trout and the Isis Farmhouse.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-538290541_super.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,United Kingdom,97.74,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,186361,"([('Pitt Rivers Museum', 'The Pitt Rivers Museum is one of Oxford’s most popular attractions, famous for its period atmosphere and outstanding collections from many cultures around the world, past and present.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/99/0b/fc/the-building-does-the.jpg'), ('Oxford University Museum of Natural History', ""The Museum of Natural History houses the University's scientific collections of geological and zoological specimens.

182,cancun,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/cancun," Cancun is a tale of two cities, with the Zona Hotelera offering majestic Caribbean beaches and Maya culture and Cancún Centro providing the local flavor. One look at Cancún's aquamarine Caribbean waters and it makes perfect sense why planners back in the 1970s were so eager to develop the area as Mexico's next big resort destination. With about 19km of powdery white-sand beaches in the Zona Hotelera and a quieter 15km stretch of coast north of downtown, Cancún is a beach bum's haven. You'll find some of the most swimmable waters on the Zona Hotelera's north side, between Km 4 and Km 9, while north of Cancún Centro, Isla Blanca beckons with its long stretch of relatively undeveloped coastline. When most people think of Cancún, wild party town comes to mind. But rest assured that you can also soak up some Maya culture in between the fiestas. The Museo Maya de Cancún, a world-class museum with some 400 Maya artifacts on display, is a must-see and it's adjoining San Miguelito archaeological site is well worth checking out as well. For a day of ruins-hopping, head about 2km south to El Rey, known for its small temple and several ceremonial platforms. Cancún's Maya sites may not have the wow factor of say, a Chichén Itzá, but they provide intriguing historical context when paired with the museum visit. From Yucatecan comfort food and atmospheric downtown taco joints to Michellin-starred haute cuisine in the Zona Hotelera, Cancún's diverse culinary scene keeps your tummy thoroughly content. Classic Yucatecan menu items such as cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork with achiote and orange juice) and panuchos (bean-filled fried tortilla snacks) rank among Mexico's most iconic dishes, while thatch-roofed restaurants serving high-quality fresh fish and seafood add yet another facet to the varied dining experience. A growing number of establishments specializing in contemporary Mexican cuisine draw on Caribbean and indigenous Maya recipes to create innovative regional dishes. Outdoorsy types and children will truly appreciate the activities on offer in Cancún. Great diving and snorkeling sites are nearby, including a famous underwater sculpture museum, and in addition to ocean dives, you can hook up tours to explore nearby cenotes (limestone sinkholes) and their fascinating underwater cave systems. Nature enthusiasts will enjoy a day trip from Cancún to Isla Contoy, an uninhabited island that provides great hiking, bird-watching and snorkeling opportunities. And, of course, there's the beach, where water activities range from swimming and kayaking to kiteboarding.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/21752505.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Mexico,11.6,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,150807,"([('Playa Delfines', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/db/0a/ba/playa-delfines.jpg'), ('La Isla Shopping Village', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b6/36/f4/la-isla.jpg'), ('Xoximilco Cancun by Xcaret', 'At Xoximilco the party is for everyone.

183,san-sebastian,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/aragon-basque-country-and-navarra/san-sebastian," Framed by golden beaches and lush hillsides, San Sebastián has undeniable allure, from its venerable dining scene to its grand architecture and packed cultural calendar. San Sebastián has a justly deserved reputation as one of the world’s great dining destinations. This is a city that celebrates the art of eating well in all its many forms – whether snacking on fresh oysters and txakoli (a lightly sparkling white wine) at a seaside cafe or lingering over a decadent, multi-course feast in a Michelin-starred dining room. Pintxos (Basque tapas) bars litter the streets of San Sebastián, and showcase first-rate ingredients from the surrounding coast and countryside combined with the culinary creativity of Basque chefs. When it comes to cooking, no other city quite compares. Spain’s culinary capital is also blessed with an alluring coastline. The long Playa de la Concha is the city’s great backyard, a picturesque sweep of sandy beach that fronts gently lapping seas. Surfers head one beach over to the powerful waves that roll in off of Playa de la Zurriola, just behind the hipster enclave of Gros. Just offshore of the old town lies Isla de Santa Clara, a small hilly island that makes a fine getaway on a steamy afternoon. The city has some fine vantage points to gaze over its coastline, including the hilltop heights of Monte Urgull and Monte Igueldo. For a city of its size, San Sebastian has a staggering array of festivals and cultural events. The International Film Festival, which happens in September, brings European and Hollywood stars to town, while the Semana Grande in August features a week of street parties and revelry. There’s also music festivals, massive culinary fairs and folk fests that celebrate Basque culture in its myriad forms. Big events aside, there’s always something happening in San Sebastián, with performances at the cutting-edge Kursaal, the belle époque Teatro Victoria Eugenia or the Tabakalera – the city’s newest arts space. Once a favourite destination for Spanish royalty, San Sebastián has lost none of its lustre over the years. Elegant art nouveau buildings, ornate bridges and beautifully manicured parks and plazas create a captivating backdrop to this seaside city. Far from being mere set pieces, the grand architecture remains an integral part of San Sebastián, from the lavish Hotel Maria Cristina to the belle époque spa perched over the shoreline. Meanwhile, the old buildings lining the cobblestone streets of the Parte Vieja have been given new life with charming guesthouses, colourful boutiques and buzzing pintxos bars all part of the great and vibrant mix that is San Sebastián.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/GettyImages-163188684_medium.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,Spain,22,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,187457,"([('La Concha Beach', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/eb/80/5f/playa-de-la-concha.jpg'), ('Monte Urgull', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/56/6b/9a/caption.jpg'), ('Parte Vieja', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/e6/c6/d5/parte-vieja.jpg'), ('Monte Igueldo', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/42/bd/d2/monte-igueldo.jpg'), ('Peine del Viento', ""A modern iron sculpture by Eduardo Chillida embedded in the rocks at the water's edge."", 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/21/91/3d/peine-del-viento.jpg'), ('Aquarium', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/4f/2f/2f/aquarium.jpg'), ('Zurriola Beach', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/56/53/74/caption.jpg'), ('San Telmo Museoa', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/56/47/56/caption.jpg'), ('Miramar Palace', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/10/13/1d/b7/fachada-principal.jpg'), ('Plaza de la Constitucion', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/5b/47/53/plaza-de-la-constitucion.jpg'), ('Ondarreta Beach', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/09/6e/e3/b7/ondarreta-beach.jpg'), ('Funicular Monte Igueldo', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/10/8a/70/de/entry.jpg'), ('Buen Pastor Cathedral', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/6d/cf/4e/caption.jpg'), ('Basilica de Santa Maria del Coro', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/92/3d/12/caption.jpg'), ('Eureka!

205,bilbao,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/aragon-basque-country-and-navarra/bilbao," Staggering architecture, a venerable dining scene and stunning landscapes just outside the city centre: Bilbao is one of the great treasures of the Basque Country. The great landmark perched over the Nervión played a pivotal role in transforming the fortunes of this once industrial city. More than two decades after its unveiling, Frank Gehry’s shimmering titanium-clad Guggenheim museum has lost none of its ability to captivate. Today though, this artfully designed icon stands among other great architectural works, like the nearby Zubizuri, a soaring bridge designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the Azkuna Zentroa, a wine storage warehouse turned cultural centre that bears the imaginative imprint of Philippe Starck. The city also has its share of beauties from the past, including a neo-baroque theatre, an art nouveau train station and several spectacular cathedrals. Tucked into a lush corner of Northeast Spain, Bilbao is surrounded by rolling green hills, with breathtaking coastline an easy jaunt from town. Parks and plazas dot the city centre, including the Parque de Doña Casilda de Iturrizar with its tree-lined paths and ornamental pond, while riverside promenades give fine views of the cityscape. The heights of Artxanda offer an even more impressive panoramic sweep of the city, and is best reached by the funicular that lumbers its way to the top. Further out, Getxo's beaches and dramatic cliffs make for a spectacular day’s outing. The dining scene in Bilbao staggers the imagination. Here you’ll find Michelin-starred eateries, buzzing pintxo bars and long-running family-run restaurants all offering a different take on Basque cuisine. The cobblestone streets of the old town offer endless rewards for foodies, whether munching one’s way through the eateries lining the Plaza Nueva or taking in the glimmering food halls of the Mercado de la Ribera. Adding to the bounty is a new crop of appealing cafes and low-lit wine bars, fine spots for unwinding, catching up on local gossip and plotting the next great meal! Basque culture takes on many forms in this thriving waterfront city. Evocative museums like the Euskal Museoa and the Arkeologi Museo provide a glimpse into centuries past, with their collections of ancient Basque carvings, Middle Age treasures and everyday implements of the mariners, artisans and landowners of this age-old people. Leaping forward a few centuries, the Basque spirit is very much alive in performing arts halls like the Euskalduna Palace or on music-filled stages around town, with Kafe Antzokia serving up the city’s latest sounds. Then of course, there’s the hallowed Estadio San Mamés, where the 100% Basque team of Athletic Bilbao take the field.

Beneath, the bustling bazaar area is draped in a thick veneer of tour agencies, souvenir shops and tandoori-pizza restaurants, but a web of lanes quickly fans out into a green suburban patchwork of irrigated barley fields. Here, gushing streams and narrow footpaths link traditionally styled Ladakhi garden homes that double as charming, inexpensive guesthouses.

The plants are preserved from further squandering of natures most delicate and little protected flora gems. This destruction is manifested in the pursuit of food, financial return and greed. OM continues to seek areas of destruction to preserve for the grandchildren of the world an expanding collection of this diversity in a sanctuary of preservation in the valley of San Cristobal, Chiapas. As of October 2014, the collection has over 25,000 rescued plants, comprising 600 species native to Chiapas.

237,salvador,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/salvador," Salvador da Bahia has an energy and unadorned beauty that few cities can match. Once the magnificent capital of Portugal’s New World colony, today Salvador is the pulsating heart of the country’s Afro-Brazilian community. Its brilliantly hued center is a living museum of 17th- and 18th-century architecture and gold-laden churches. Wild festivals happen frequently, with drum corps pounding out rhythms against the backdrop of colonial buildings almost daily. Elsewhere in town, a different spirit flows as crowds of religious adherents celebrate and reconnect with African gods at Candomblé ceremonies. In fact, there’s no other place in the world where the culture of those brought as slaves from Africa has been preserved as it has been in Salvador – from music and religion to food, dance and martial-arts traditions. Aside from the many attractions within Salvador, a gorgeous coastline lies right outside the city – a suitable introduction to the tropical splendor of Bahia.",https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/81388447.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&vib=20&sharp=10&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=1600&q=40&dpr=5 5x,El Salvador,60,Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,303272,"([('Ilha dos Frades', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/2560x500/0c/95/33/be/vista-aerea-de-ponta.jpg'), ('Pelourinho', 'Sometimes called the ""city within a city,"" this old part of Salvador is worth visiting for its cobblestone streets, pastel-colored buildings, churches, restaurants, shops and nightlife.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/3a/dd/23/photo1jpg.jpg'), ('Casa do Rio Vermelho', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/97/6d/70/casa-do-rio-vermelho.jpg'), ('Flamengo Beach', 'Beach in Salvador da Bahia.', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/bf/b4/05/paisagem-da-praia-do.jpg'), ('Praia Farol da Barra', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/33/52/07/farol-da-barra.jpg'), ('Praia do Forte', '', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/21/a0/2d/pileta.jpg'), ('Praia do Porto da Barra', ""Porto da Barra is one of the few points of land in Brazil that face west over the Atlantic Ocean (due to its unique geography near the entrance to the Bay of All Saints).
